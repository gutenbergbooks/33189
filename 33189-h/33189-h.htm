<p><span class="bold">CARNEGIE, ANDREW<a name="ar1" id="ar1"></a></span> (1837-&emsp;&emsp;), American &ldquo;captain of
industry&rdquo; and benefactor, was born in humble circumstances
in Dunfermline, Scotland, on the 25th of November 1837. In
1848 his father, who had been a Chartist, emigrated to America,
settling in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania. The raw Scots lad
started work at an early age as a bobbin-boy in a cotton factory,
and a few years later was engaged as a telegraph clerk and
operator. His capacity was perceived by Mr T.A. Scott of
the Pennsylvania railway, who employed him as a secretary;
and in 1859, when Scott became vice-president of the company,
he made Carnegie superintendent of the western division of the
line. In this post he was responsible for several improvements
in the service; and when the Civil War opened he accompanied
Scott, then assistant secretary of war, to the front. The first
sources of the enormous wealth he subsequently attained
were his introduction of sleeping-cars for railways, and his
purchase (1864) of Storey Farm on Oil Creek, where a large
profit was secured from the oil-wells. But this was only a
preliminary to the success attending his development of the
iron and steel industries at Pittsburg. Foreseeing the extent to
which the demand would grow in America for iron and steel,
he started the Keystone Bridge works, built the Edgar Thomson
steel-rail mill, bought out the rival Homestead steel works, and
by 1888 had under his control an extensive plant served by
tributary coal and iron fields, a railway 425 m. long, and a line
of lake steamships. As years went by, the various Carnegie
companies represented in this industry prospered to such an
extent that in 1901, when they were incorporated in the United
States Steel Corporation, a trust organized by Mr J. Pierpont
Morgan, and Mr Carnegie himself retired from business, he was
bought out at a figure equivalent to a capital of approximately
£100,000,000.</p>

<p>From this time forward public attention was turned from the
shrewd business capacity which had enabled him to accumulate
such a fortune to the public-spirited way in which he devoted
himself to utilizing it on philanthropic objects. His views on
social subjects, and the responsibilities which great wealth
involved, were already known in a book entitled <i>Triumphant
Democracy,</i> published in 1886, and in his <i>Gospel of Wealth</i>
(1900). He acquired Skibo Castle, in Sutherlandshire, Scotland,
and made his home partly there and partly in New York; and
he devoted his life to the work of providing the capital for
purposes of public interest, and social and educational advancement.
Among these the provision of public libraries in the
United States and United Kingdom (and similarly in other
English-speaking countries) was especially prominent, and
&ldquo;Carnegie libraries&rdquo; gradually sprang up on all sides, his
method being to build and equip, but only on condition that
the local authority provided site and maintenance, and thus to
secure local interest and responsibility. By the end of 1908 he
had distributed over £10,000,000 for founding libraries alone.
He gave £2,000,000 in 1901 to start the Carnegie Institute at
Pittsburg, and the same amount (1902) to found the Carnegie
Institution at Washington, and in both of these, and other,
cases he added later to the original endowment. In Scotland
he gave £2,000,000 in 1901 to establish a trust for providing funds
for assisting education at the Scottish universities, a benefaction
which resulted in his being elected lord rector of St Andrews
University. He was a large benefactor of the Tuskegee Institute
under Booker Washington for negro education. He also
established large pension funds&mdash;in 1901 for his former employés
at Homestead, and in 1905 for American college professors.
His benefactions in the shape of buildings and endowments
for education and research are too numerous for detailed enumeration,
and are noted in this work under the headings of the various
localities. But mention must also be made of his founding of
Carnegie Hero Fund commissions, in America (1904) and in the
United Kingdom (1908), for the recognition of deeds of heroism;
his contribution of £500,000 in 1903 for the erection of a Temple
of Peace at The Hague, and of £150,000 for a Pan-American
Palace in Washington as a home for the International Bureau
of American republics. In all his ideas he was dominated by
an intense belief in the future and influence of the English-speaking
people, in their democratic government and alliance for
the purpose of peace and the abolition of war, and in the progress
of education on unsectarian lines. He was a powerful supporter
of the movement for spelling reform, as a means of promoting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page365" id="page365"></a>365</span>
the spread of the English language. Mr Carnegie married in
1887 and had one daughter. Among other publications by him
were <i>An American Four-in-hand in Britain</i> (1883), <i>Round the
World</i> (1884), <i>The Empire of Business</i> (1902), a <i>Life of James
Watt</i> (1905) and <i>Problems of To-day</i> (1908).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CARNEGIE,<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span> a borough of Allegheny county, Pennsylvania,
U.S.A., 6 m. S.W. of Pittsburg. Pop. (1900) 7330 (1816 being
foreign-born); (1910) 10,009. It is served by the Pittsburg, Cincinnati,
Chicago &amp; St Louis, the Pittsburg, Chartiers &amp; Youghiogheny,
and the Wabash Pittsburg Terminal railways, and the
Pittsburg street railway. Carnegie is situated in the beautiful
valley of Chartiers Creek, and is in one of the coal and natural
gas districts of the state. In the borough are a Carnegie library
and St Paul&rsquo;s orphan asylum. Among the borough&rsquo;s manufactures
are steel, lead, glass, ploughs and enamel- and tin-ware.
There are alkaline and lithia mineral springs here. In 1894
Carnegie, named in honour of Andrew Carnegie, was formed by
the union of the boroughs Chartiers and Mansfield.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CARNELIAN,<a name="ar3" id="ar3"></a></span> a red variety of chalcedony, much used as an
ornamental stone, especially for seals. The old name was
cornelian, said to have been given in reference either to the
horny appearance of the stone (Lat. <i>cornu</i>, &ldquo;horn&rdquo;) or to its
resemblance in colour to the berry of the cornel; but the original
word was corrupted to carnelian, probably in allusion to its
reddish colour (<i>carneus</i>, &ldquo;flesh-coloured&rdquo;). Some carnelian,
however, is brown, yellow or even white. Certain kinds of
brown and bright red chalcedony, much resembling carnelian,
pass under the name of sard (<i>q.v.</i>). The Hebrew <i>odem</i> was
probably a red stone, either carnelian, sard or jasper. All
carnelian is translucent and is thus distinguished from jasper
of similar colour, which is always opaque. The red colour of
typical carnelian is due to the presence of ferric oxide. This is
often developed artificially by exposure to sunshine, or to
artificial heat, whereby any ferric hydrate in the stone becomes
more or less dehydrated; or the stone is treated with a solution
of an iron salt, like ferrous sulphate, and then heated, when
ferric oxide is formed in the pores of the stone. An opaque
white surface is sometimes produced artificially on a red
carnelian: this is said to be done by coating the stone with
carbonate of soda and then placing it on a red-hot iron; or by
using a mixture of potash, white lead and certain vegetable
juices, and heating it on charcoal. Inscriptions and figures in
white on red carnelian (&ldquo;burnt carnelian&rdquo;) are well known from
the East. Much carnelian comes from India, being mostly
derived from agate-gravels, resulting from the disintegration of
the Deccan traps, in the neighbourhood of Ratanpur, near
Broach. A good deal of the carnelian now sold, however, is
Brazilian agate, artificially stained. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Agate</a></span>.)</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CARNESECCHI, PIETRO<a name="ar4" id="ar4"></a></span> (1508-1567), Italian humanist, was
the son of a Florentine merchant, who under the patronage of
the Medici, and especially of Giovanni de&rsquo; Medici as Pope
Clement VII., rapidly rose to high office at the papal court. He
came into touch with the new learning at the house of his
maternal uncle, Cardinal Bernardo Dovizzi, in Rome. At the
age of twenty-five he held several rich livings, had been notary
and protonotary to the Curia, and was first secretary to the
pope, in which capacity he conducted the correspondence with
the nuncios (among them Pier Paolo Bergerio in Germany) and a
host of other duties. By his conduct at the conference with
Francis I. at Marseilles he won the favour of Catherine de&rsquo;
Medici and other influential personages at the French court, who
in later days befriended him. He made the acquaintance of
the Spanish reformer Juan de Valdes at Rome, and got to know
him as a theologian at Naples, being especially drawn to him
through the appreciation expressed by Bernardino Ochino, and
through their mutual friendship with the Lady Julia Gonzaga,
whose spiritual adviser he became after the death of Valdes.
He became a leading spirit in the literary and religious circle
that gathered round Valdes in Naples, and that aimed at effecting
from within the spiritual reformation of the church. Under
Valdes&rsquo; influence he whole-heartedly accepted Luther&rsquo;s doctrine
of justification by faith, though he repudiated a policy of schism.
When the movement of suppression began, Carnesecchi was implicated.
For a time he found shelter with his friends in Paris, and
from 1552 he was in Venice leading the party of reform in that
city. In 1557 he was cited (for the second time) before the
tribunal in Rome, but refused to appear. The death of Paul IV.
and the accession of Pius IV. in 1559 made his position easier,
and he came to live in Rome. With the accession of Pius V.
(Michael Ghislieri) in 1565 the Inquisition renewed its activities
with fiercer zeal than ever. Carnesecchi was in Venice when the
news reached him, and betook himself to Florence, where, thinking
himself safe, he was betrayed by Cosimo, the duke, who wished
to curry favour with the pope. From July 1566 he lay in prison
over a year. On the 21st of September 1567 sentence of degradation
and death was passed on him and sixteen others, ambassadors
from Florence vainly kneeling to the pope for some mitigation,
and on the 1st of October he was publicly beheaded and then
burned.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CARNIOLA<a name="ar5" id="ar5"></a></span> (Ger. <i>Krain</i>), a duchy and crown-land of Austria,
bounded N. by Carinthia, N.E. by Styria, S.E. and S. by
Croatia, and W. by Görz and Gradisca, Trieste and Istria. It
has an area of 3856 sq. m. Carniola is for the most part a mountainous
region, occupied in the N. by the Alps, and in the S. by
the Karst (<i>q.v.</i>) or Carso Mountains. It is traversed by the
Julian Alps, the Karawankas and the Steiner Alps, which
belong all to the southern zone of the Eastern Alps. The highest
point in the Julian Alps is formed by the three sugar-loaf peaks of
the Triglav or Terglou (9394 ft.), which offers one of the finest
views in the whole of the Alps, and which bears on its northern
declivity the only glacier in the province. The Triglav is the
dividing range between the Alps and the Karst Mountains, and
its huge mass also forms the barrier between three races: the
German, the Slavonic and the Italian. Other high peaks are the
Mangart (8784 ft.) and the Jaluz (8708 ft.). The Karawankas,
which form the boundary between Carinthia and Carniola, have
as their highest peak the Stou or Stuhlberg (7344 ft.), and are
traversed by the Loibl Pass (4492 ft.). They are continued by
the Steiner or Santhaler Alps, which have as their highest peak
the Grintouz or Grintovc (8393 ft.). This peak is situated on the
threefold boundary of Carinthia, Carniola and Styria, and affords
a magnificent view of the whole Alpine neighbouring region.
The southern part of Carniola is occupied by the following
divisions of the northern ramifications of the Karst Mountains:
the Birnbaumer Wald with the highest peak, the Nanos (4275 ft.),
and the Krainer Schneeberg (5890 ft.); the Hornwald with the
highest peak, the Hornbüchl (3608 ft.), and the Uskokengebirge
(3874 ft.). The portion of Carniola belonging to the Karst
region presents a great number of caves, subterranean streams,
funnels and similar phenomena. Amongst the best-known are
the grottos of Adelsberg, the larger ones of Planina and the
Kreuzberghöhle near Laas.</p>

<p>With the exception of the Idria and the Wippach, which as
tributaries of the Isonzo belong to the basin of the Adriatic,
Carniola belongs to the watershed of the Save. The Save or Sau
rises within the duchy, and is formed by the junction at Radmannsdorf
of its two head-streams the Wurzener Save and the
Wocheiner Save. Its principal affluents are the Kanker and the
Steiner Feistritz on the left, and the Zeyer or Sora, the Laibach
and the Gurk on the right. The most remarkable of these rivers
is the Laibach, which rises in the Karst region under the name of
Poik, takes afterwards a subterranean course and traverses the
Adelsberg grotto, and appears again on the surface near Planina
under the name of Unz. Shortly after this it takes for the
second time a subterranean course, to appear finally on the
surface near Oberlaibach. The small torrent of Rothwein, which
flows into the Wurzener Save, forms near Veldes the splendid
series of cascades known as the Rothwein Fall. Amongst the
principal lakes are the Wochein, the Weissenfels, the Veldes,
and the seven small lakes of the Triglav; while in the Karst
region lies the famous periodical lake of Zirknitz, known to the
Romans as <i>Lacus Lugens</i> or <i>Lugea Palus.</i></p>

<p>The climate is rather severe, and the southern part is exposed
to the cold north-eastern wind, known as the Bora. The mean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page366" id="page366"></a>366</span>
annual temperature at Laibach is 48.4° F., and the rainfall
amounts to 72 ins. Of the total area only 14.8% is under
cultivation, and the crops do not suffice for the needs of the
province; forests occupy 44.4%, 17.2% are meadows, 15.7%
are pastures, and 1.17% of the soil is covered by vineyards.
Large quantities of flax are grown, while the timber trade is of
considerable importance. Fish and game are plentiful, and the
silkworm is bred in the warmer districts. The principal mining
product is mercury, extracted at Idria, while iron and copper
ore, zinc and coal are also found. The industry is not well
developed, but the weaving of linen and lace is pursued as a
household industry.</p>

<p>Carniola had in 1900 a population of 508,348, which corresponds
to 132 inhabitants per sq. m. Nearly 95% were Slovenes
and 5% Germans, while 99% of the population belonged to the
Roman Catholic Church. The local diet, of which the bishop of
Laibach is a member <i>ex officio,</i> is composed of thirty-seven
members, and Carniola sends eleven deputies to the Reichsrat at
Vienna. For administrative purposes the province is divided
into eleven districts and one autonomous municipality, Laibach
(pop. 36,547), the capital. Other important places are Oberlaibach
(5882), Idria (5772), Gurkfeld (5294), Zirknitz (5266),
Adelsberg (3636), Neumarktl (2626), Krainburg (2484) and
Gottschee (2421).</p>

<p>Carniola derives its modern name from the Slavonic word
<i>Krajina</i> (frontier). During the Roman Empire it formed part of
Noricum and Pannonia. The Slavonic population settled here
during the end of the 6th and the beginning of the 7th century.
Conquered by Charlemagne, the most of the district was bestowed
on the duke of Friuli; but in the 10th century the title of
margrave of Carniola began to be borne by a family resident in
the castle of Kieselberg near Krainburg. Various parts of the
present territory were, however, held by other lords, such as the
duke of Carinthia and the bishop of Freising. Towards the close
of the 14th century all the separate portions had come by inheritance
or bequest into the hands of Rudolph IV. of Austria,
who took the title of duke of Carniola; and since then the duchy
has remained a part of the Austrian possessions, except during
the short period from 1809 to 1813, when it was incorporated
with the French Illyrian Provinces. In 1849 it became a separate
crown-land.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARNIVAL<a name="ar6" id="ar6"></a></span> (Med. Lat. <i>carnelevarium</i>, from <i>caro, carnis,</i>
flesh, and <i>levare</i>, to lighten or put aside; the derivation from
<i>valere</i>, to say farewell, is unsupported), the last three days preceding
Lent, which in Roman Catholic countries are given up to
feasting and merry-making. Anciently the carnival was held
to begin on twelfth night (6th January) and last till midnight
of Shrove Tuesday. There is little doubt that this period of
licence represents a compromise which the church always inclined
to make with the pagan festivals and that the carnival really
represents the Roman Saturnalia. Rome has ever been the
headquarters of carnival, and though some popes, notably
Clement IX. and XI. and Benedict XIII., made efforts to stem
the tide of Bacchanalian revelry, many of the popes were great
patrons and promoters of carnival keeping. Paul II. was notable
in this respect. In his time the Jews of Rome were compelled
to pay yearly a sum of 1130 golden florins (the thirty being added
as a special memorial of Judas and the thirty pieces of silver),
which was expended on the carnival. A decree of Paul II.,
minutely providing for the diversions, orders that four rings of
silver gilt should be provided, two in the Piazza Navona and two
at the Monte Testaccio&mdash;one at each place for the burghers and
the other for the retainers of the nobles to practise riding at the
ring. The pope also orders a great variety of races, the expenses
of which are to be paid from the papal exchequer&mdash;one to be
run by the Jews, another for Christian children, another for
Christian young men, another for sexagenarians, a fifth for
asses, and a sixth for buffaloes. Under Julius III. we have long
accounts of bull-hunts&mdash;or rather bull-baits&mdash;in the Forum,
with gorgeous descriptions of the magnificence of the dresses,
and enormous suppers in the palace of the Conservatori in the
capitol, where seven cardinals, together with the duke Orazio
Farnese, supped at one table, and all the ladies by themselves
at another. After the supper the whole party went into the
courtyard of the palace, which was turned into the semblance of
a theatre, &ldquo;to see a most charming comedy which was admirably
played, and lasted so long that it was not over till ten
o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo; Even the austere and rigid Paul IV. (<i>ob</i>. 1559)
used to keep carnival by inviting all the Sacred College to dine
with him. Sixtus V., who was elected in 1585, set himself to the
keeping of carnival after a different fashion. Determined to
repress the lawlessness and crime incident to the period, he set
up gibbets in conspicuous places, as well as whipping-posts,
the former as a hint to robbers and cut-throats, the latter in
store for minor offenders. We find, further, from the provisions
made at the time, that Sixtus reformed the evil custom of throwing
dirt and dust and flour at passengers, permitting only flowers
or sweetmeats to be thrown.</p>

<p>The later popes for the most part restricted the public festivities
of the carnival to the last six or seven days immediately
preceding Ash Wednesday. The municipal authorities of the
city, on whom the regulation of such matters now depends, allow
ten days. The carnival sports at Rome anciently consisted of
three divisions: (1) the races in the Corso (formerly called the
Via Lata, and taking its present name from them), which appear
to have been from time immemorial a part of the festivity; (2) the
spectacular pageant of the Agona; (3) that of the Testaccio.</p>

<p>Of other Italian cities, Venice used in old times to be the
principal home, after Rome, of carnival. To-day Turin, Milan,
Florence, Naples, all put forth competing programmes. In
old times Florence was conspicuous for the licentiousness of its
carnival; and the <i>Canti Carnascialeschi</i>, or carnival songs, of
Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici show to what extent the licence was carried.
The carnival in Spain lasts four days, including Ash Wednesday.
In France the merry-making is restricted almost entirely to
Shrove Tuesday, or <i>mardi gras</i>. In Russia, where no Ash
Wednesday is observed, carnival gaieties last a week from Sunday
to Sunday.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARNIVORA,<a name="ar7" id="ar7"></a></span> the zoological order typified by the larger
carnivorous placental land mammals of the present day, such
as lions, tigers and wolves, but also including species like bears
whose diet is largely vegetable, as well as a number of smaller
flesh-eating species, together with the seals and their relatives,
and an extinct Tertiary group. Apart from this distinct group
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Creodonta</a></span>), the Carnivora are characterized by the following
features. They are unguiculate, or clawed mammals, with
never less than four toes to each foot, of which the first is never
opposable to the rest; the claws, or nails, being more or less
pointed although occasionally rudimentary. The teeth comprise
a deciduous and a permanent series, all being rooted, and the
latter divisible into the usual four series. In front there is a series
of small pointed incisors, usually three in number, on each side
of both jaws, of which the first is always the smallest and the third
the largest, the difference being most marked in the upper
jaw; these are followed by strong conical, pointed, recurved
canines; the premolars and molars are variable, but generally,
especially in the anterior part of the series, more or less compressed,
pointed and trenchant; if the crowns are flat and
tuberculated, they are never complex or divided into lobes by
deep inflexions of enamel. The condyle of the lower jaw is a
transversely placed half-cylinder working in a deep glenoid
fossa of corresponding form. The brain varies much in size
and form, but the hemispheres are never destitute of convolutions.
The stomach is always simple and pyriform; the
caecum is either absent or short and simple; and the colon is
not sacculated or much wider than the small intestine. Vesiculae
seminales are never developed, but Cowper&rsquo;s glands may be
present or absent. The uterus is two-horned, and the teats are
abdominal and variable in number; while the placenta is
deciduate, and almost always zonary. The clavicle is often
absent, and when present never complete. The radius and ulna
are distinct; the scaphoid and lunar of the tarsus are united;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page367" id="page367"></a>367</span>
there is never an os centrale in the adult; and the fibula is
distinct.</p>

<p>The large majority of the species subsist chiefly on animal
food, though many are omnivorous, and a few chiefly vegetable-eaters.
The more typical forms live altogether on recently-killed
warm-blooded animals, and their whole organization is
thoroughly adapted to a predaceous mode of life. In conformity
with this manner of obtaining their subsistence, they are generally
bold and savage in disposition, though some are capable
of being domesticated, and when placed under favourable circumstances
exhibit a high degree of intelligence.</p>

<p class="pt2">The typical section of the group, the Carnivora Vera, Fissipedia
or Carnassidentia, includes all the existing terrestrial members
of the order, together with the otters and sea-otters. In this
section the fore-limbs never have the first digit, or the hind-limbs
the first and fifth digits, longer than the others; and the
incisors are <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> on each side, with very rare exceptions. The
cerebral hemispheres are more or less elongated; always with
three or four convolutions on the outer surface forming arches
above each other, the lowest surrounding the Sylvian fissure.
In the cheek-series there is one specially modified tooth in each
jaw, to which the name of &ldquo;sectorial&rdquo; or &ldquo;carnassial&rdquo; is
applied. The teeth in front of this are more or less sharp-pointed
and compressed; the teeth behind broad and tuberculated.
The characters of the sectorial teeth deserve special
attention, as, though fundamentally the same throughout the
group, they are greatly modified in different genera. The upper
sectorial is the most posterior of the teeth which have predecessors,
and is therefore reckoned as the last premolar (p. 4 of
the typical dentition). It consists of a more or less compressed
blade supported on two roots and an inner lobe supported by
a distinct root (see fig. 1). The blade when fully developed
has three cusps (i, 2 and 3), but the anterior is always small,
and often absent. The middle cusp is conical, high and pointed;
and the posterior cusp has a compressed, straight, knife-like edge.
The inner cusp. (4) varies in extent, but is generally placed near
the anterior end of the blade, though sometimes median in
position. In the <i>Ursidae</i> alone both the inner cusp and its root
are wanting, and there is often a small internal and posterior
cusp (5) without root. In this family also the sectorial is relatively
to the other teeth much smaller than in other Carnivora.
The lower sectorial (fig. 2) is the most anterior of the teeth
without predecessors in the milk-series, and is therefore reckoned
the first molar. It has two roots supporting a crown, consisting
when fully developed of a compressed bilobed blade (1 and 2),
a heel (4), and an inner tubercle (3). The cusps of the blade,
of which the hinder (2) is the larger, are separated by a notch,
generally prolonged into a linear fissure. In the specialized
<i>Felidae</i> (I) the blade alone is developed, both heel and inner
tubercle being absent or rudimentary. In <i>Meles</i> (V) and <i>Ursus</i>
(VI) the heel is greatly developed, broad and tuberculated.
The blade in these cases is generally placed obliquely, its flat
or convex (outer) side looking forwards, so that the two lobes
or cusps are almost side by side, instead of anterior and posterior.
The inner tubercle (3) is generally a conical pointed cusp, placed
to the inner side of the hinder lobe of the blade. The special
characters of these teeth are more disguised in the sea-otter
than in any other species, but even here they can be traced.</p>

<p class="pt2">The toes are nearly always armed with large, strong, curved
and sharp claws, ensheathing the terminal phalanges and held
firmly in place by broad plates of bone reflected over their
attached ends from the bases of the phalanges. In the <i>Felidae</i>
these claws are &ldquo;retractile&rdquo;; the terminal phalange with the
claw attached, folding back in the fore-foot into a sheath by the
outer or ulnar side of the middle phalange of the digit, and
retained in this position when at rest by a strong elastic ligament.
In the hind-foot the terminal joint or phalange is retracted
on to the top, and not the side of the middle phalange. By the
action of the deep flexor muscles the terminal phalanges are
straightened, the claws protruded from their sheath, and the
soft &ldquo;velvety&rdquo; paw becomes suddenly converted into a formidable
weapon of offence. The habitual retraction of the claws
preserves their points from wear.</p>

<p>The land Carnivora are best divided into two subgroups or
sections&mdash;(A) the Aeluroidea, or Herpestoidea, and (B) the
Arctoidea; the recognition of a third section, Cynoidea, being
rendered untenable by the evidence of extinct forms.</p>

<p>(A) <i>Aeluroidea</i>.&mdash;In this section, which comprises the cats
(<i>Felidae</i>), civets (<i>Viverridae</i>), and hyenas (<i>Hyaenidae</i>), the
tympanic bone is more or less ring-like, and forms only a part
of the outer wall of the tympanic cavity; an inflated alisphenoid
bulla is developed; and the external auditory meatus is short.
In the nasal chamber the maxillo-turbinal is small and doubly
folded, and does not cut off the naso-turbinal and adjacent
bones from the nasal aperture. The carotid canal in the skull
is short or absent. Cowper&rsquo;s glands are present, as is a prostate
gland and a caecum, as well as a duodenal-jejunal flexure in
the intestine, but an os penis is either wanting or small.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The members of the cat tribe, or <i>Felidae</i>, are collectively characterized
by the following features. An alisphenoid is lacking on the
lower aspect of the skull. In existing forms the usual
dental formula is i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>, m. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>; the upper molar
<span class="sidenote">Cat tribe.</span>
being rudimentary and placed on the inner side of the carnassial,
but the first premolar may be absent, while, as an abnormality, there
may be a small second lower molar, which is constantly present in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id="page368"></a>368</span>
some of the extinct forms. The auditory bulla and the tympanic
are divided by an internal partition. The paroccipital process is
separate from, or only extends to a slight degree upon the auditory
bulla. The thoracic vertebrae number 13; the feet are digitigrade,
with five front and four hind toes, of which the claws are retractile;
and the metatarsus is haired all round. Anal glands are present.</p>

<p>As regards the teeth, when considered in more detail, the incisors
are small, and the canines large, strong, slightly recurved, with
trenchant edges and sharp points, and placed wide apart. The premolars
are compressed and sharp-pointed; the most posterior in
the upper jaw (the sectorial) being a large tooth, consisting of a
compressed blade, divided into three unequal cusps supported by
two roots, with a small inner lobe placed near the front and supported
by a distinct root (fig. 1, I). The upper molar is a small tubercular
tooth placed more or less transversely at the inner side of the hinder
end of the last. In the lower jaw the molar (sectorial) is reduced to
the blade, which is large, trenchant, compressed and divided into
two subequal lobes (fig. 2, I). Occasionally it has a rudimentary
heel, but never an inner tubercle. The skull generally is short and
rounded, though proportionally more elongated in the larger forms;
with the facial portion short and broad, and the zygomatic arches
wide and strong. The auditory bullae are large, rounded and smooth.
Vertebrae: C. 7, D. 13, L. 7, S. 3, Ca. 13-29. Clavicles better
developed than in other Carnivora, but not articulating with either
the shoulder-bones or sternum. Of the five front toes, the third and
fourth are nearly equal and longest, the second slightly, and the
fifth considerably shorter. The first is still shorter, not reaching the
metacarpophalangeal articulation of the second. In the hind-feet
the third and fourth toes are the longest, the second and fifth somewhat
shorter and nearly equal, while the first is represented only by
the rudimentary metatarsal bone. The claws are large, strongly
curved, compressed, very sharp, and exhibit the retractile condition
in the highest degree. The tail varies greatly in length, being in
some species a mere stump, in others nearly as long as the body.
The ears are of moderate size, more or less triangular and pointed;
and the eyes rather large, with the iris mobile, and with a pupillary
aperture which contracts under the influence of light in some species
to a narrow vertical slit, in others to an oval, and in some to a circular
aperture. The tongue is thickly covered with sharp, pointed, recurved
horny papillae; and the caecum is small and simple.</p>

<p>As in structure so in habits, the cat may be considered the most
specialized of all Carnivora, although they exhibit many features
connecting them with extinct types. All the members of the group
feed almost exclusively on warm-blooded animals which they have
themselves killed, but one Indian species, <i>Felis viverrina</i>, is said to
prey on fish, and even fresh-water molluscs. Unlike dogs, they
never associate in packs, and rarely hunt their prey on open ground,
but from some place of concealment wait until the unsuspecting
victim comes within reach, or with noiseless and stealthy tread,
crouching close to the ground for concealment, approach near enough
to make the fatal spring. In this manner they frequently attack
and kill animals considerably exceeding their own size. They are
mostly nocturnal, and the greater number, especially the smaller
species, more or less arboreal. None are aquatic, and all take to
the water with reluctance, though some may habitually haunt the
banks of rivers or pools, because they more easily obtain their prey
in such situations. The numerous species are widely diffused over
the greater part of the habitable world, though most abundant in
the warm latitudes of both hemispheres. None are, however, found
in the Australian region, or in Madagascar. Although the Old
World and New World cats (except perhaps the northern lynx) are
all specifically distinct, no common structural character has been
pointed out by which the former can be separated from the latter.
On the contrary, most of the groups into which the family may be
divided have representatives in both hemispheres.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the considerable diversity in external appearance
and size between different members of this extensive family, the
structural differences are but slight. The principal differences are
to be found in the form of the cranium, especially of the nasal and
adjoining bones, the completeness of the bony orbit posteriorly,
the development of the first upper premolar and of the inner lobe
of the upper sectorial, the length of the tail, the form of the pupil,
and the condition and coloration of the fur, especially the presence
or absence of tufts or pencils of hair on the external ears.</p>

<p>In the typical genus <i>Felis</i>, which includes the great majority of
the species, and has a distribution coextensive with that of the
family, the upper sectorial tooth has a distinct inner cusp, the claws
are completely contractile, the tail is long or moderate, and the ears
do not carry distinct tufts of hair. As regards the larger species, the
lion (<i>F. leo</i>), tiger (<i>F. tigris</i>), leopard (<i>F. pardus</i>), ounce or snow-leopard
(<i>F. uncia</i>) and clouded leopard (<i>F. nebulosa</i>) are described
in separate articles. Of other Old World species it must suffice to
mention that the Tibetan Fontanier&rsquo;s cat (<i>F. tristis</i>), and the Indian
marbled cat (<i>F. marmorata</i>), an ally of the above-mentioned clouded
leopard, appear to be the Asiatic representatives of the American
ocelots. The Tibetan Pallas&rsquo;s cat (<i>F. manul</i>) has been made the
type of a distinct genus, <i>Trichaelurus</i>, in allusion to its long coat.
One of the largest of the smaller species is the African serval, <i>q.v.</i>
(<i>F. serval</i>), which is yellow with solid black spots, has long limbs,
and a relatively short tail. Numerous &ldquo;tiger-cats&rdquo; and &ldquo;leopard-cats,&rdquo;
such as the spotted <i>F. bengalensis</i> and the uniformly chestnut
<i>F. badia</i>, inhabit tropical Asia; while representative species occur
in Africa. The jungle-cat (<i>F. chaus</i>), which in its slightly tufted
ears and shorter tail foreshadows the lynxes, is common to both
continents. Another African species (<i>F. ocreata</i>) appears to have
been the chief progenitor of the European domestic cat, which has,
however, apparently been crossed to some extent with the ordinary
wild cat (<i>F. catus</i>). Of the New World species, <i>F. concolor</i>, the puma
or couguar, commonly called &ldquo;panther&rdquo; in the United States,
is about the size of a leopard, but of a uniform brown colour, spotted
only when young, and is extensively distributed in both North and
South America, ranging between the parallels of 60° N. and 50° S.,
where it is represented by numerous local races, varying in size and
colour. <i>F. onca</i>, the jaguar, is a larger and more powerful animal
than the last, and more resembles the leopard in its colours; it is
also found in both North and South America, although with a less
extensive range, reaching northwards only as far as Texas, and
southwards nearly to Patagonia (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Jaguar</a></span>). <i>F. pardalis</i> and
several allied smaller, elegantly-spotted species inhabiting the
intratropical regions of America, are commonly confounded under
the name of ocelot or tiger-cat. <i>F. yaguarondi</i>, rather larger than
the domestic cat, with an elongated head and body, and of a uniform
brownish-grey colour, ranges from northern Mexico to Paraguay;
while the allied <i>F. eyra</i> is a small cat, weasel-like in form, having an
elongated head, body and tail, and short limbs, and is of a uniform light
reddish-brown colour. It is a native of South America and Mexico.
<i>F. pajeros</i> is the Pampas cat.</p>

<p>The typical lynxes, as represented by <i>Lynx borealis</i> (<i>L. lynx</i>), the
southern <i>L. pardina</i>, and the American <i>L. rufa</i>, are a northern group
common to both hemispheres, and characterized by their tufted
ears, short tail, and the presence of a rudimentary heel to the lower
carnassial tooth. As a rule, they are more or less spotted in winter,
but tend to become uniformly-coloured in summer. They are connected
with the more typical cats by the long-tailed and uniformly
red caracal, <i>Lynx (Caracal) caracal</i>, of India, Persia and Africa, and
the propriety of separating them from <i>Felis</i> may be open to doubt
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lynx</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Caracal</a></span>).</p>

<p>However this may be, there can be no doubt of the right of the
hunting-leopard or chita (cheeta), as, in common with the leopard,
it is called in India, to distinction from all the other cats as a distinct
genus, under the name of <i>Cynaelurus jubatus</i>. From all the other
<i>Felidae</i> this animal, which is common to Asia and Africa, is distinguished
by the inner lobe of the upper sectorial tooth, though
supported by a distinct root, having no salient cusp upon it, by the
tubercular molar being more in a line with the other teeth, and by
the claws being smaller, less curved and less completely retractile,
owing to the feebler development of the elastic ligaments. The
skull is short and high, with the frontal region broad and elevated
in consequence of the large development of air-sinuses. The head is
small and round, the body light, the limbs and tail long, and the colour
pale yellowish-brown with small solid black spots (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cheeta</a></span>).</p>

<p>The family <i>Viverridae</i>, which includes the civet-cats, genets and
mongooses, is nearly allied to the <i>Felidae</i>, but its members have
a fuller dentition, and exhibit certain other structural
differences from the cats, to the largest of which they
<span class="sidenote">Civet tribe.</span>
make no approach in the matter of bodily size. As a rule,
there is an alisphenoid canal;  the cheek-dentition is
p. <span class="spp">3 or 4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3 or 4</span>, m. <span class="spp">1 or 2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1 or 2</span>
The bulla is small and the tympanic large, with a low
division between them; and the paroccipital process is leaf-like
and spread over the bulla. The number of dorsal vertebrae, except
in the aberrant <i>Proteles</i>, is 13 or 14; the claws may be either
completely or partially retractile or non-retractile; generally
each foot has five toes, but there may be four in front and five
behind, the reverse of this, or only four on each foot; the gait may
be either digitigrade or partially plantigrade; and the metatarsus
may be either hairy or naked inferiorly. Anal, and in some cases
also perineal, glands are developed. The family is limited to the
warmer parts of the Old World.</p>

<p>Considerable difference of opinion prevails with regard to the
serial position of the fossa, or foussa (<i>Cryptoprocta ferox</i>), of
Madagascar, some writers considering that its affinities are so close to the
<i>Felidae</i> that it ought not to be included in the present family at
all. Others, on the contrary, see no reason to separate it from the
<i>Viverrinae</i> or more typical representatives of the civet-tribe. As a
medium course, it may be regarded as the sole representative of a
special subfamily&mdash;<i>Cryptoproctinae</i>&mdash;of the <i>Viverridae</i>. The subfamily
and genus are characterized by possessing a total of 36
teeth, arranged as i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>, m. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>. The teeth generally closely
resemble those of the <i>Felidae</i>, the first premolar of both jaws being
very minute and early deciduous; the upper sectorial has a small
inner lobe, quite at the anterior part; the molar is small and placed
transversely; and the lower sectorial has a large trenchant bilobed
blade, and a minute heel, but no inner tubercle. The skull is generally
like that of <i>Felis</i>, but proportionally longer and narrower, with
the orbit widely open behind. Vertebrae: C. 7, D. 13, L. 7, S. 3,
Ca. 29. Body elongated. Limbs moderate in size. Feet subplantigrade,
with five well-developed toes on each, carrying
sharp, compressed, retractile claws. Ears moderate. Tail long and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page369" id="page369"></a>369</span>
cylindrical. The foussa is a sandy-coloured animal with an exceedingly
long tail (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Foussa</a></span>).</p>

<p>The more typical members of the group, constituting the subfamily
<i>Viverrinae</i>, are characterized by their sharp, curved and largely
retractile claws, the presence of five toes to each foot, and of perineal
and one pair of anal glands, and a tympanic bone which retains to a
great extent the primitive ring-like form, so that the external auditory
meatus has scarcely any inferior lip, its orifice being close to the
tympanic ring. The first representatives of the subfamily are the
civet-cats, or civets (<i>Viverra</i> and <i>Viverricula</i>), and the genets
(<i>Genetta</i>), in all of which the dentition is i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>, m. <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>; total 40.
The skull is elongated, with the facial portion small and compressed,
and the orbits well-defined but incomplete behind. Vertebrae:
C. 7, D. 13, L. 7 (or D. 14, L. 6), S. 3, Ca. 22-30. Body elongated
and compressed. Head pointed in front; ears rather small. Extremities
short. Feet small and rounded. Toes short, the first on
fore and hind feet much shorter than the others. Palms and soles
covered with hair, except the pads of the feet and toes, and in some
species a narrow central line on the under side of the sole, extending
backwards nearly to the heel. Tail moderate or long. The pair
of large glands situated on the perineum (in both sexes) secretes an
oily substance of a peculiarly penetrating odour. In the true civets,
which include the largest members of the group, the teeth are stouter
and less compressed than in the other genera; the second upper
molar being especially large, and the auditory bulla smaller and
more pointed in front; the body is shorter and stouter; the limbs
are longer; the tail shorter and tapering. The under side of the
tarsus is completely covered with hair, and the claws are longer and
less retractile. Fur rather long and loose, and in the middle line of
the neck and back especially elongated so as to form a sort of crest
or mane. Pupil circular when contracted. Perineal glands greatly
developed. These characters apply especially to <i>V. civetta</i>, the
African civet, or civet-cat, as it is commonly called, an animal
rather larger than a fox, and an inhabitant of intratropical Africa.
<i>V. zibetta</i>, the Indian civet, of about equal size, approaches in many
respects, especially in the characters of the teeth and feet and
absence of the crest of elongated hair on the back, to the next section.
It inhabits Bengal, China, the Malay Peninsula and adjoining
islands. <i>V. tangalunga</i> is a smaller but nearly allied animal from
the same part of the world. From these three species and the next
the civet of commerce, once so much admired as a perfume in
England, and still largely used in the East, is obtained. The
animals are kept in cages, and the odoriferous secretion collected by
scraping the interior of the perineal follicles with a spoon or spatula.
The single representative of the genus <i>Viverricula</i> resembles in many
respects the genets, but agrees with the civets in having the whole
of the under side of the tarsus hairy; the alisphenoid canal is generally
absent. <i>V. malaccensis</i>, the rasse, inhabiting India, China,
Java and Sumatra, is an elegant little animal which affords a
favourite perfume to the Javanese. The genets (<i>Genetta</i>) are smaller
animals, with more elongated and slender bodies, and shorter limbs
than the civets. The skull is elongated and narrow; and the
auditory bulla large, elongated and rounded at both ends. The
teeth are compressed and sharp-pointed, with a lobe on the inner
side of the third, upper premolar not present in the previous genera.
Pupil contracting to a linear aperture. Tail long, slender, ringed.
Fur short and soft, spotted or cloudy. Under side of the metatarsus
with a narrow longitudinal bald streak. <i>Genetta vulgaris</i>, or <i>G.
genetta</i>, the common genet, is found in France south of the river
Loire, Spain, south-western Asia and North Africa. <i>G. felina,
senegalensis, tigrina, victoriae</i> and <i>pardalis</i> are other named species,
all African in habitat.</p>

<p>The Malagasy fossane (<i>Fossa daubentoni</i>), which has but little
markings on the fur of the adult, differs by the absence of a scent-pouch
and the presence of a couple of bare spots on the under surface
of the metatarsus. The beautiful linsangs (<i>Linsanga</i> or <i>Prionodon</i>),
ranging from the eastern Himalaya to Java and Borneo, are represented
by two or three species, easily recognizable by the broad
transverse bands of blackish brown and yellow with which the body
and tail are marked. They are specially distinguished by having
only one pair of upper molars, thereby resembling the cats, with
which, in correlation with their arboreal habits, they agree in their
highly retractile claws, and the hairy surface of the under side of the
metatarsus. About 15 in. is the length of the type species. In
West Africa the linsangs are represented by <i>Poiana richardsoni</i>, a
small species with a spotted genet-like coat, and also with a narrow
naked stripe on the under surface of the metatarsus, as in genets.</p>

<p>Here may be placed the two African spotted palm-civets of the
genus <i>Nandinia</i>, namely <i>N. binotata</i> from the west and <i>N. gerrardi</i>
from the east forest-region. In common with the true palm-civets,
they have a dentition numerically identical with that of <i>Viverra</i>
and <i>Genetta</i>, but the cusps of the hinder premolars and molars are
much less sharp and pointed. They are peculiar in that the wall of
the inner chamber of the auditory bulla never ossifies, while the
paroccipital process is not flattened out and spread over the bulla.
In this respect they resemble the Miocene European genus <i>Amphictis</i>,
as they do in the form of their teeth, so that they may be regarded as
nearly related to the ancestral <i>Viverridae</i>, and forming in some
degree a connecting link between the present and the next subfamily.
<i>Nandinia</i> is also peculiar in possessing a kind of rudimentary
marsupial pouch. Apparently <i>Eupleres goudoti</i>, of Madagascar,
which has been generally classed in the <i>Herpestinae</i>, is a nearly
related animal, characterized by the reduction of its dentition, due
to insectivorous habits (fig. 3); the canines being small, the anterior
premolars canine-like, and the hinder premolars molariform. It is
a uniformly-coloured creature of medium size.</p>

<p>The palm-civets, or paradoxures, constituting the Asiatic genus
<i>Paradoxurus</i>, have, as already stated, the following dental formula,
viz. i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>, m. <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>, total 40; the cusps of the molars being
low and blunted, and these teeth in the upper jaw much broader
than in the civets. The head is pointed in front, with small rounded
ears; the limbs are of medium length, with the soles of the feet
almost completely naked, and fully retractile claws; while the long
tail is not prehensile and clothed with hair of moderate length.
Spots are the chief type of marking. The vertebrae number C. 7,
D. 13, L. 7, S. 3, Ca. 29-36. Numerous relatively large species
ranging from India to Borneo, Sumatra and Celebes, with one in
Tibet, represent the genus. Nearly allied are <i>Arctogale leucotis</i>,
with a wide distribution, and <i>A. trivirgata</i>, of Java, both longitudinally
striped species, with small and slightly separated molars, and a
prolonged bony palate (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Palm-civet</a></span>).</p>

<p>The binturong (<i>Arctictis binturong</i>) has typically the same dental
formula as the last, but the posterior upper molar and the first lower
premolar are often absent. Molars small and rounded, with a distinct
interval between every two, but formed generally on the same
pattern as <i>Paradoxurus</i>. Vertebrae: C. 7, D. 14, L. 5, S. 3, Ca. 34.
Body elongated; head broad behind, with a small pointed face,
long and numerous whiskers, and small ears, rounded, but clothed
with a pencil of long hairs. Eyes small. Limbs short, with the
soles of the feet broad and entirely naked. Tail very long and
prehensile. Fur long and harsh. Caecum extremely small. The
binturong inhabits southern Asia from Nepal through the Malay
Peninsula to the islands of Sumatra and Java. Although structurally
agreeing closely with the paradoxures, its tufted ears, long,
coarse and dark hair, and prehensile tail give it a very different
external appearance. It is slow and cautious in its movements,
chiefly if not entirely arboreal, and appears to feed on vegetables as
well as animal substances (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Binturong</a></span>).</p>

<p><i>Hemigale</i> is another modification of the paradoxure type, represented
by <i>H. hardwickei</i> of Borneo, an elegant-looking animal,
smaller and more slender than the paradoxures, of light grey colour,
with transverse broad dark bands across the back and loins.</p>

<p><i>Cynogale</i> also contains one Bornean species, <i>C. bennetti</i>, a curious
otter-like modification of the viverrine type, having semi-aquatic
habits, both swimming in the water and climbing trees, living upon
fish, crustaceans, small mammals, birds and fruits. The number
and general arrangement of the teeth are as in <i>Paradoxurus</i>, but the
premolars are peculiarly elongated, compressed, pointed and recurved,
though the molars are tuberculated. The head is elongated,
with the muzzle broad and depressed, the whiskers are very long
and abundant, and the ears small and rounded. Toes short and
slightly webbed at the base. Tail short, cylindrical, covered with
short hair. Fur very dense and soft, of a dark-brown colour, mixed
with black and grey.</p>

<p>In the mongoose group, or <i>Herpestinae</i>, the tympanic or anterior
portion of the auditory bulla is produced into an ossified external
auditory meatus of considerable length; while the paroccipital
process never projects below the bulla, on the hinder surface of
which, in adult animals, it is spread out and completely lost. The
toes are straight, with long, unsheathed, non-retractile claws.</p>

<p>In the typical mongooses or ichneumons, <i>Herpestes</i>, the dental
formula is i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. <span class="spp">(4 or 3)</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">(4 or 3)</span>, m. <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>; total 40 or 36; the molars
having generally strongly-developed, sharply-pointed cusps. The
skull is elongated and constricted behind the orbits. The face is
short and compressed, with the frontal region broad and arched.
Post-orbital processes of frontal and jugal bones well developed,
generally meeting so as to complete the circle of the orbit behind.
Vertebrae: C. 7, D. 13, L. 7, S. 3, Ca. 21-26. Head pointed in front.
Ears short and rounded. Body long and slender. Extremities
short. Five toes on each foot, the first, especially that on the hind-foot,
very short. Toes free, or but slightly palmated. Soles of
fore-feet and terminal portion of those of hind-pair naked; under
surface of metatarsus clothed with hair. Tail long or moderate,
generally thick at the base, and sometimes covered with more or
less elongated hair. The longer hairs covering the body and tail
almost always ringed. The genus is common to the warmer parts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page370" id="page370"></a>370</span>
Asia and Africa, and while many of the species, like the Egyptian
<i>H. ichneumon</i> and the ordinary Indian mongoose, <i>H. mungo</i>, are
pepper-and-salt coloured, the large African <i>H. albicauda</i> has the
terminal two-thirds of the tail clothed with long white hairs (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ichneumon</a></span>).</p>

<p>The following distinct African and Malagasy generic representatives
of the subfamily are recognized, viz. <i>Helogale</i>, with <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> premolars,
and containing the small South African <i>H. parvula </i>and a variety of
the same. <i>Bdeogale crassicauda</i> and two allied tropical African
species differ from <i>Herpestes</i> in having only four toes on each foot.
The orbit is nearly complete, and the tail of moderate length and
rather bushy. In <i>Cynictis</i>, which has the orbit completely closed,
there are five front and four hind toes; and the skull is shorter and
broader than in <i>Herpestes</i>, rather contracted behind the orbits, the
face short, and the anterior chamber of the auditory bulla very
large. The front claws are elongated. Includes only <i>C. penicillata</i>
from South Africa.</p>

<p>All the foregoing herpestines have the nose short, with its under
surface flat, bald, and with a median longitudinal groove. The
remaining forms have the nose more or less produced, with its
under side convex, and a space between the nostrils and the upper
lip covered with closely pressed hairs, and without any median
groove. The South African <i>Rhynchogale muelleri</i>, a reddish animal
with five toes to each foot and <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span> (abnormally <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span>) premolars, alone
represents the first genus. The cusimanses (<i>Crossarchus</i>), which
differ by having only <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> premolars, and thus a total of 36 teeth,
include, on the other hand, several species. The muzzle is elongated,
the claws on the fore-feet are long and curved, the first front toe is
very short; the under surface of the metatarsus naked; and the
tail shorter than the body, tapering. Fur harsh. Includes <i>C. obscurus</i>,
the cusimanse, a small burrowing animal from West Africa,
of uniform dark-brown colour, <i>C. fasciatus, C. zebra, C. gambianus</i>
and others. Lastly, we have <i>Suricata</i>, a more distinct genus than
any of the above. The dental formula is as in the last, but the teeth
of the molar series are remarkably short in the antero-posterior
direction, corresponding with the shortness of the skull generally.
Orbits complete behind. Vertebrae: C. 7, D. 15, L. 6, S. 3, Ca. 20.
Though the head is short and broad, the nose is pointed and rather
produced and movable, while the ears are very short. Body shorter
and limbs longer than in <i>Herpestes</i>. Toes 4-4. Claws on fore-feet
very long and narrow, arched, pointed and subequal. Hind-feet
with shorter claws, soles hairy. Tail rather shorter than the body.
One species only is known, the meerkat or suricate, <i>S. tetradactyla</i>,
a small grey-brown animal, with dark transverse stripes on the
hinder part of the back, from South Africa.</p>

<p>The names <i>Galidictis, Galidia</i> and <i>Hemigalidia</i> indicate three
generic modifications of the <i>Herpestinae</i>, all inhabitants of Madagascar.
The best-known, <i>Galidia elegans, is </i>a lively squirrel-like
little animal with soft fur and a long bushy tail, which climbs and
jumps with agility. It is of a chestnut-brown colour, the tail being
ringed with darker brown. <i>Galidictis vittata</i> and <i>G. striata</i> chiefly
differ from the ichneumons in their coloration, being grey with
parallel longitudinal stripes of dark brown.</p>

<p>Considerable diversity of opinion prevails with regard to the
serial position of the aard-wolf, or maned jackal (<i>Proteles cristatus</i>),
of southern and eastern Africa, some authorities making it the
representative of a family by itself, others referring it to the
<i>Hyaenidae</i>, while others again regard it as a modified member of the
<i>Viverridae</i>. After all, the distinction either way cannot be very
great, since the two families just named are intimately connected
by marks of the extinct <i>Ictitherium</i>, With the <i>Viverridae</i> it agrees
in having the auditory bulla divided, while in the number of dorsal
vertebrae it is hyena-like. The cheek-teeth are small, far apart,
and almost rudimentary in character (see fig. 4), and the canines
long and rather slender. The dental formula is i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p.m. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3 or 4</span>;
total 30 or 32. Vertebrae: C. 7, D. 15, L. 5, S. 2, Ca. 24. The
fore-feet with five toes; the first, though short, with a distinct claw.
The hind-feet with four subequal toes; all, like those of the fore-foot,
furnished with strong, blunt, non-retractile claws (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Aard-Wolf</a></span>).</p>

<p>The hyenas or hyaenas (<i>Hyaenidae</i>) differ from the preceding
family (<i>Viverridae</i>) in the absence of a distinct vertical partition
between the two halves of the auditory bulla; and are
further characterized by the absence of an alisphenoid
<span class="sidenote">Hyena tribe.</span>
canal, the reduction of the molars to <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, and the presence
of 15 dorsal vertebrae. The dental formula in the existing forms
(to which alone all these remarks apply) is i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>. p. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> m. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>;
total 34; the teeth, especially the canines and premolars, being very
large, strong and conical. Upper sectorial with a large, distinctly
trilobed blade and a moderately developed inner lobe placed at the
anterior extremity of the blade. Molar very small, and placed transversely
close to the hinder edge of the last, as in the <i>Felidae</i>. Lower
sectorial consisting of little more than the bilobed blade. Zygomatic
arches of skull very wide and strong; and sagittal crest high, giving
attachment to very powerful biting muscles. Orbits incomplete
behind. Vertebrae: C. 7, D. 15, L. 5, S. 4, Ca. 19. Limbs rather
long, especially the anterior pair, digitigrade, four subequal toes on
each, with stout non-retractile claws, the first toes being represented
by rudimentary metacarpal and metatarsal bones. Tail rather
short. A large post-anal median glandular pouch, into which the
largely developed anal scent glands pour their secretion.</p>

<p>The three well-characterized species of <i>Hyaena</i> are divisible into
two sections, to which some zoologists assign generic rank. In the
typical species the upper molar is moderately developed and three-rooted;
and an inner tubercle and heel more or less developed
on the lower molar. Ears large and pointed. Hair long, forming a
mane on the back and shoulders. Represented firstly by <i>H. striata</i>,
the striped hyena of northern and eastern Africa and southern
Asia; and <i>H. brunnea</i> of South Africa, in some respects intermediate
between this and the next section. In the second section, forming the
subgenus <i>Crocuta</i>, the upper molar is extremely small, two- or one-rooted,
often deciduous; the lower molar without trace of inner
tubercle, and with an extremely small heel. Ears moderate, rounded.
Hair not elongated to form a mane. The spotted hyena, <i>Hyaena
(Crocuta) crocuta</i>, of which, like the striped species, there are several
local races, represents this group, and ranges all over Africa south
of the Sahara. In dental characters the first section inclines more
to the <i>Viverridae</i>, the second to the <i>Felidae</i>; or the second may be
considered as the more specialized form, as it certainly is in its
visceral anatomy, especially in that of the reproductive organs of
the female. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hyena</a></span>.)</p>
</div>

<p>(B) <i>Arctoidea</i>.&mdash;So far as the auditory region of the skull
is concerned, the existing representatives of the dog tribe or
<i>Canidae</i> are to a great extent intermediate between the cat and
civet group (<i>Aeluroidea</i>) on the one hand, and the typical
representatives of the bear and weasel group on the other.
They were consequently at one time classed in an intermediate
group&mdash;the Cynoidea; but fossil forms show such a complete
transition from dogs to bears as to demonstrate the artificial
character of such a division. Consequently, the dogs are included
in the bear-group. In this wider sense the Arctoidea
will be characterized by the tympanic bone being disk-shaped
and forming the whole of the outer wall of the tympanic cavity;
the large size of the external auditory meatus or tube; and the
large and branching maxillo-turbinal bone, which cuts off the
naso-turbinal and two adjacent bones from the anterior nasal
chamber. The tympanic bulla has no internal partition. There
is a large carotid canal. Cowper&rsquo;s glands are lacking; and there
is a large penial bone.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>From all the other members of the group the <i>Canidae</i> are broadly
distinguished (in the case of existing forms) by the large and well-developed
tympanic bulla, with which the paroccipital
process is in contact. An alisphenoid canal is present.
<span class="sidenote">Dog tribe.</span>
The feet are digitigrade, usually with five (in one instance four)
front and always four hind-toes. The molars&mdash;generally <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>&mdash;have
tall cusps, and the sectorials are large and powerful (figs. 1
and 2). The intestine has both a duodeno-jejunal flexure and a
caecum. A prostate gland is present; but there are no glands in
the vasa deferentia; the penial bone is grooved; and anal glands
are generally developed. The distribution of the family is cosmopolitan.
The normal dentition is i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>, m. <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>; total 42;
thus differing from the typical series only by the loss of the last pair
of upper molars (present in certain extinct forms). In the characters
of the teeth the group is the most primitive of all Carnivora. Typically
the upper secterial (fig. 1, II) consists of a stout blade, of which
the anterior cusp is almost obsolete, the middle cusp large, conical
and pointed backwards, and the posterior cusp in the form of a
compressed ridge; the inner lobe is very small, and placed at the
fore part of the tooth. The first molar is more than half the antero-posterior
length of the sectorial, and considerably wider than long;
its crown consists of two prominent conical cusps, of which the
anterior is the larger, and a low, broad inward prolongation, supporting
two more or less distinct cusps and a raised inner border. The
second molar resembles the first in general form, but is considerably
smaller. The lower sectorial (fig. 2, II) is a large tooth, with a
strong compressed bilobed blade, the hinder lobe being considerably
the larger and more pointed, a small but distinct inner tubercle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page371" id="page371"></a>371</span>
placed at the hinder margin of the posterior lobe of the blade, and
a broad, low, tuberculated heel, occupying about one-third of the
whole length of the tooth. The second molar is less than half the
length of the first, with a pair of cusps placed side by side anteriorly,
and a less distinct posterior pair. The third is an extremely small
and simple tooth with a subcircular tuberculated crown and single
root.</p>

<p>Views differ in regard to the best classification of the <i>Canidae</i>,
some writers adopting a number of generic groups, while others consider
that very few meet the needs of the case. In retaining the old
genus <i>Canis</i> in the wide sense, that is to say, inclusive of the foxes,
Professor Max Weber is followed. The best cranial character by
which the different members of the family may be distinguished is
that in dogs, wolves and jackals the post-orbital process of the
frontal bone is regularly smooth and convex above, with its extremity
bent downwards, whereas in foxes the process is hollowed above,
with its outer margin (particularly of the anterior border) somewhat
raised. This modification coincides in the main with the division
of the group into two parallel series, the Thooids or Lupine forms
and Alopecoids or Vulpine forms, characterized by the presence
of frontal air-sinuses in the former, which not only affects the
external form but to a still greater degree the shape of the anterior
part of the cranial cavity, and the absence of such sinuses in the
latter. The pupil of the eye when contracted is round in most
members of the first group, and vertically elliptical in the others,
but more observations are required before this character can be
absolutely relied upon. The form and length of the tail is often used
for the purposes of classification, but its characters do not coincide
with those of the cranium, as many of the South American <i>Canidae</i>
have the long bushy tails of foxes and the skulls of wolves.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 5.&mdash;The African Hunting-Dog (<i>Lycaon pictus</i>).</td></tr></table>

<p>The most aberrant representative of the thooid series is the
African hunting-dog (<i>Lycaon pictus</i>, fig. 5), which differs from the
other members of this series by the teeth being rather more massive
and rounded, the skull shorter and broader, and the presence of
but four toes on each limb, as in <i>Hyena</i>. The hunting-dog, from
south and east Africa, is very distinct externally from all other
<i>Canidae</i>; being nearly as large as a mastiff, with large, broadly
ovate erect ears and a singular colouring, often consisting of unsymmetrical
large spots of white, yellow and black. It presents
some curious superficial resemblances to <i>Hyena crocuta</i>, perhaps a
case of mimetic analogy, and hunts its prey in large packs. Several
local races, one of which comes from Somaliland, differing in size
and colour, are recognized (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hunting-Dog</a></span>). Nearly related to
the hunting-dog are the dholes or wild dogs of Asia, as represented
by the Central Asian <i>Cyan primaevus</i> and the Indo-Malay <i>C.
javanicus</i>. They have, however, five front-toes, but lack the last
lower molar; while they agree with <i>Lycaon</i> and <i>Speothos</i> in that
the heel of the lower sectorial tooth has only a single compressed
cutting cusp, in place of a large outer and a smaller inner cusp as in
<i>Canis</i>. Dholes are whole-coloured animals, with short heads;
and hunt in packs. The bush-dog (<i>Speothos</i>, or <i>Icticyon venaticus</i>)
of Guiana is a small, short-legged, short-tailed and short-haired
species characterized by the molars being only <span class="spp">2 or 1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>; the carnassial
having no inner cusp. The long-haired raccoon-dog (<i>Nyctereutes
procyonoides</i>) of Japan and China agrees essentially in everything
but general appearance (which is strangely raccoon-like) with <i>Canis</i>.
The typical group of the latter includes some of the largest members
of the family, such as the true wolves of the northern parts of both
Old and New Worlds (<i>C. lupus, &amp;c.</i>), and the various breeds of the
domestic dog (<i>C. familiaris</i>), the origin of which is still involved in
obscurity. Some naturalists believe it to be a distinct species,
descended from one that no longer exists in a wild state; others
have sought to find its progenitors in some one of the wild or half-wild
races, either of true dogs, wolves or jackals; while others again
believe that it is derived from the mingling of two or more wild
species or races. It is probably the earliest animal domesticated
by man, and few if any other species have undergone such an extraordinary
amount of variation in size, form and proportion of limbs,
ears and tail, variations which have been perpetuated and increased
by careful selective breeding (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Dog</a></span>). The dingo or Australian
dog is met with wild, and also as the domestic companion of the
aboriginal race of the country, by whom it appears to have been
originally introduced. It is nearly related to a half-wild dog inhabiting
Java, and also to the pariah dogs of India and other eastern
countries. Dogs were also in the possession of the natives of New
Zealand and other islands of the Pacific, where no placental mammals
exist naturally, on their discovery by Europeans in the 18th century.
The slender-jawed <i>C. simensis</i> of Abyssinia and the South American
<i>C. jubatus</i> and <i>C. antarcticus</i> are also generally placed in this group.
On the other hand, the North American coyote (<i>C. latrans</i>), with its
numerous subspecies, and the Old World jackals, such as the Indo-European
<i>C. aureus</i> the Indian <i>C. pallipes</i>, and the African <i>C.
lupaster, C. anthus, C. adustus, C. variegatus</i> and <i>C. mesomelas</i> (the
black-backed jackal), although closely related to the wolves, have
been placed in a separate group under the name of <i>Lupulus</i>. Again,
<i>Thous</i> (or <i>Lycalopex</i>), is a group proposed for certain South American
<i>Canidae</i>, locally known as foxes, and distinguished from all the
foregoing by their fox-like aspect and longer tails, although with
skulls of the thöoid type. Among these are the bright-coloured
colpeo, <i>C. magellanicus</i>, the darker <i>C. thous, C. azarae, C. griseus,
C. cancrivorus</i> and <i>C. brasiliensis</i>. Some of these, such as <i>C. azarae</i>
and <i>C. griseus</i>, show a further approximation to the fox in that the
pupil of the eye forms a vertical slit. More distinct from all the preceding
are the members of the alopecoid or vulpine section, which are
unknown in South America. The characteristic feature of the skull
has been already mentioned. In addition to this, reference may be
made to the elliptical (in place of circular) pupil of the eye, and the
general presence of ten (rarely eight) teats instead of a smaller
number. The typical groups constituting the subgenus (or genus)
<i>Vulpes</i>, is represented by numerous species and races spread over
the Old World and North America. Foremost among these is the
European fox (<i>C. vulpes</i>&mdash;otherwise <i>Vulpes alopex</i>, or <i>V. vulpes</i>),
represented in the Himalaya by the variety <i>C. v. montanus</i> and in
North Africa by <i>C. v. niloticus</i>, while the North American <i>C. pennsylvanicus</i>
or <i>fulvus</i>, can scarcely be regarded as more than a local race.
On the other hand, the Asiatic <i>C. bengalensis</i> and <i>C. corsac</i>, and the
North American <i>C. velox</i> (kit-fox) are smaller and perfectly distinct
species. From all these the North American <i>C. cinereo-argentatus</i>
(grey fox) and <i>C. littoralis</i> are distinguished by having a fringe of
stiff hairs in the tail, whence they are separated as <i>Urocyon</i>. Again,
the Arctic fox (<i>C. lagopus</i>), of which there is a blue and a white phase,
has the tail very full and bushy and the soles of the feet thickly
haired, and has hence been distinguished as <i>Leucocyon</i>. Lastly, we
have the elegant little African foxes known as fennecs (<i>Fennecus</i>),
such as <i>C. zerda</i> and <i>C. famelicus</i> of the north, and the southern
<i>C. chama</i>, all pale-coloured animals, with enormously long ears,
and correspondingly inflated auditory bullae to the skull (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Wolf</a></span>,
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Jackal</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fox</a></span>).</p>

<p>Whatever differences of opinion may obtain among naturalists
as to the propriety of separating generically the foxes from the
wolves and dogs, there can be none as to the claim of the long-eared
fox (<i>Otocyon megalotis</i>) of south and east Africa to represent a
genus by itself. In this animal the dental formula is i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>,
m. <span class="spp">3 or 4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>; total 46 or 48. The molar teeth being in excess of almost
all other placental mammals with a differentiated series of teeth.
They have the same general characters as in <i>Canis</i>, with very pointed
cusps. The lower sectorial shows little of the typical character,
having five cusps on the crown-surface; these can, however, be
identified as the inner tubercle, the two greatly reduced and obliquely
placed lobes of the blade, and two cusps on the heel. The skull
generally resembles that of the smaller foxes, particularly the fennecs.
The auditory bullae are very large. The hinder edge of the lower
jaw has a peculiar form, owing to the great development of an expanded,
compressed and somewhat inverted subangular process.
Vertebrae: C. 7, D. 13, L. 7, S. 3, Ca. 22. Ears very large. Limbs
rather long, with the normal number of toes. The two parietal
ridges on the skull remain widely separated, so that no sagittal
crest is formed. The animal is somewhat smaller than an ordinary
fox. In the year 1880 Professor Huxley suggested that in the long-eared
fox we have an animal nearly representing the stock from
which have been evolved all the other representatives of the dog
and fox tribe. One of the main grounds for arriving at this conclusion
was the fact that this animal has very generally four true molars in
each jaw, and always that number in the lower jaw; whereas three
is the maximum number of these teeth to be met with in nearly
all placental mammals, other than whales, manatis, armadillos
and certain others. The additional molars in <i>Otocyon</i> were regarded
as survivals from a primitive type when a larger number was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page372" id="page372"></a>372</span>
rule. Palaeontology has, however, made great strides since 1880,
and the idea that the earlier mammals had more teeth than their
descendants has not only received no confirmation, but has been
practically disproved. Consequently Miss Albertina Carlsson had a
comparatively easy task (in a paper published in the <i>Zoologisches
Jahrbuch</i> for 1905) in demonstrating that the long-eared fox is a
specialized, and to some extent degraded, form rather than a
primitive type. This, however, is not all, for the lady points out
that, as was suggested years previously by the present writer, the
creature is really the descendant of the fossil <i>Canis curvipalatus</i> of
northern India. This is a circumstance of considerable interest from
a distributional point of view, as affording one more instance of the
intimate relationship between the Tertiary mammalian fauna of
India and the existing mammals of Africa.</p>

<p>In regard to the members of the dog-tribe as a whole, it may be
stated that they are generally sociable animals, hunting their prey
in packs. Many species burrow in the ground; none habitually
climb trees. Though mostly carnivorous, feeding chiefly on animals
they have chased and killed themselves, many, especially among the
smaller species, eat garbage, carrion, insects, and also fruit, berries
and other vegetable substances. The upper surface of the tail
of the fox has a gland covered with coarse straight hair. This
gland, which emits an aromatic odour, is found in all <i>Canidae</i>, with
possibly the exception of <i>Lycaon pictus</i>. Although the bases of the
hair covering the gland are usually almost white, the tips are always
black; this colour being generally extended to the surrounding
hairs, and often forming dark bars on the buttocks. The dark spot
on the back of the tail is particularly conspicuous, notably in such
widely separated species as the wolves, Azara&rsquo;s dog and the fennec.</p>

<p>Although its existing representatives are very different, the bear-family
or <i>Ursidae</i>, as will be more fully mentioned in the sequel,
was in past times intimately connected with the <i>Canidae</i>.
In common with the next two families, the modern
<span class="sidenote">Bear tribe.</span>
<i>Ursidae</i> are characterized by the very small tympanic bulla,
and the broad paroccipital process, which is, however, independent
of the bulla. The feet are more or less completely plantigrade
and five-toed. The intestine has neither duodeno jejunal
flexure nor a caecum; the prostate gland is rudimentary; but
glands occur in the vasa deferentia; and the penial bone is cylindrical.
As distinctive characteristics of the <i>Ursidae</i>, may be mentioned
the presence of an alisphenoid canal on the base of the skull;
the general absence of a perforation on the inner side of the lower
end of the humerus; the presence of two pairs of upper and three of
lower molars, which are mostly elongated and low-cusped; and the
non-cutting character and fore-and-aft shortening of the upper
sectorial, which has no inner root and one inner cusp (fig. I, III.).
Anal glands are apparently wanting. The short tail, bulky build,
completely plantigrade feet and clumsy gait are features eminently
characteristic of the bears.</p>

<p>The great majority of existing bears may be included in the typical genus
<i>Ursus</i>, of which, in this wide sense, the leading characteristics
will be as follows. The dentition is i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>, m. <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> = 42;
but the three anterior premolars, above and below, are one-rooted,
rudimentary and frequently wanting. Usually the first (placed
close to the canine) is present, and after a considerable interval the
third, which is situated close to the other teeth of the cheek-series.
The fourth (upper sectorial) differs essentially from the corresponding
tooth of other Carnivora in that the inner lobe is not supported by a
distinct root; its sectorial characters being very slightly marked.
The crowns of both true molars are longer than broad, with flattened,
tuberculated, grinding surfaces; the second having a large backward
prolongation or heel. The lower sectorial has a small and indistinct
blade and greatly developed tubercular heel; the second molar is of
about the same length, but with a broader and more flattened
tubercular crown; while the third is smaller. The milk-teeth are
comparatively small, and shed at an early age. The skull is more
or less elongated, with the orbits small and incomplete behind, and
the palate prolonged considerably behind the last molar. Vertebrae:
C. 7, D. 14, L. 6, S. 5, Ca. 8-10. Body heavy. Feet broad, completely
plantigrade; the five toes on each well developed, and
armed with long compressed and moderately curved, non-retractile
claws, the soles being generally naked. Tail very short. Ears
moderate, erect, rounded, hairy. Fur generally long, soft and
shaggy.</p>

<p>Bears are animals of considerable bulk, and include among them
the largest members of the order. Though the species are not
numerous, they are widely spread over the earth, although absent
from Africa south of the Sahara and Australasia. As a rule, they
are omnivorous, or vegetable feeders, even the polar bear, which
subsists for most of the year on flesh and fish, eating grass in summer.
On the other hand, many of the brown bears live largely on salmon
in summer. Among the various species the white polar bear of the
Arctic regions, <i>Ursus (Thalassarctus) maritimus</i>, differs from the
rest by its small and low head, small, narrow and simple molars,
and the presence of a certain amount of hair on the soles of the feet.
The typical group of the genus is represented by the brown bear
(<i>U. arctus</i>) of Europe and Asia, of which there are many local races,
such as the Syrian <i>U. a. syriacus</i>, the Himalayan <i>U. a. isabellinus</i>,
the North Asiatic <i>U. a. collaris</i>, and the nearly allied Kamchadale
race, which is of great size. In Alaska the group is represented by
huge bears, which can scarcely claim specific distinctness from
<i>U. arctus</i>; and if these are ranked only as races, it is practically
impossible to regard the Rocky Mountain grizzly bear (<i>U. horribilis</i>)
as of higher rank, although it naturally differs more from the Asiatic
animal. On the other hand, the small and light-coloured <i>U. pruinosus</i>
of Tibet may be allowed specific rank. More distinct is the North
American black bear <i>U. americanus</i>, and its white relative <i>U.
kermodei</i> of British Columbia; and perhaps we should affiliate to
this group the Himalayan and Japanese black bears (<i>U. torquatus</i>
and <i>U. japonicus</i>). Very distinct is the small Malay sun-bear <i>U.
(Helarctus) malayanus</i>, characterized by its short, smooth fur,
extensile tongue, short and wide head, and broad molars. Finally,
the spectacled bear of the Andes, <i>U. (Tremarctus) ornatus</i>, which is
also a broad-skulled black species, differs from all the rest in having
a perforation, or foramen, on the inner side of the lower end of the
humerus. A second genus, <i>Melursus</i>, represented by the Indian
sloth-bear (<i>M. ursinus</i>), differs from the preceding in having only
two pairs of upper incisors, the small size of the cheek-teeth, and the
extensile lips. Ants, white-ants, fruits and honey form the chief
food of this shaggy black species,&mdash;-a diet which accounts for its
feeble dentition (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bear</a></span>).</p>

(<i>Aeluropus melanoleucus</i>).</td></tr></table>

<p>The parti-coloured bear or giant panda (<i>Aeluropus melanoleucus</i>,
fig. 6) of eastern Tibet and north-west China forms in some degree
a connecting link between the bears and the true panda, although
placed by Professor E.R. Lankester in the same family as the latter.
In the number of the teeth, and to some extent in the character of
the molars, as well as in the abbreviated tail, <i>Aeluropus</i> resembles
the bears, but in the structure of the sectorial tooth, the presence
of an extra radial carpal bone, and the osteology generally, it is
more like the panda. In the absence of an alisphenoid canal to the
skull it differs both from the latter and the bears, and thereby
resembles the raccoons; while in having a perforation at the lower
end of the humerus, it agrees with the spectacled bear, the panda
and raccoons. The dentition is i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, m. <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>; total 40;
premolars increasing in size from first to last, and two-rooted except
the first; the first upper molar with quadrate crown, broader than
long; and the second larger than the first. Skull with the zygomatic
arches and sagittal crest immensely developed, ascending
branch of lower jaw very high, giving great space for attachment of
temporal muscle, and facial portion short. Bony palate not extending
behind the last molar. No alisphenoid canal. Feet bear-like,
but soles more hairy, and perhaps less completely plantigrade.
Fur long and thick; and tail extremely short. Humerus with a
perforation on the inner side of the lower end; a very large extra
radial carpal bone. The colour of this strange animal is black and
white (fig. 6).</p>

<p>With the panda (<i>Aelurus fulgens</i>) we reach an undoubted representative
of the <i>Procyonidae</i>, or raccoon tribe, differing, however, from
all the rest except the doubtful <i>Aeluropus</i>, in its Asiatic habitat.
If the latter be included, the family may be defined as follows.
Molars <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>, except in <i>Aeluropus</i>, with blunt or sharp cusps; no
alisphenoid canal, except in <i>Aelurus</i>; humerus generally with a
foramen; feet plantigrade; tail, except in <i>Aeluropus</i>, long and
generally ringed.</p>

<p>In the panda the dentition is i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>, m. <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>; total 38; the
first lower molar being minute and deciduous, and the upper molars
broad with numerous and complicated cusps. Vertebrae: C. 7,
D. 14, L. 6, S. 3, Ca. 18. Skull high and compressed, with an alisphenoid
canal, a short facial portion, and the ascending branch
of the lower jaw, as in <i>Aeluropus</i>, very tall. Face cat-like, with
moderate, erect, pointed ears. Claws blunt. Tail cylindrical and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page373" id="page373"></a>373</span>
ringed. Fur long and thick. Extra radial carpal bone moderate.
The panda is a bright golden red animal, with black under-parts,
ranging from the eastern Himalaya to north-western China, where
it is represented by a distinct race. Fossil species occur in the later
Tertiary deposits of Europe (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Panda</a></span>).</p>

<p>The raccoons (<i>Procyon</i>) are the first and typical representatives
of the American section of the family, in which an alisphenoid canal
is always wanting. In this genus the dentition is i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>, m. <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>;
total 40; the upper molars being broad and tuberculated; the upper
sectorial (like that of <i>Aeluropus</i> and <i>Aelurus</i>) having three outer
cusps and a broad bicuspid inner lobe, giving an almost quadrate
form to the crown. First upper molar with a large tuberculated
crown, rather broader than long; second considerably smaller,
with transversely oblong crown. Lower sectorial (first molar) with
an extremely small and ill-defined blade, placed transversely in
front, and a large inner tubercle and heel; second molar as long as
the first, but narrower behind, with five obtuse cusps. Vertebrae:
C. 7, D. 14, L. 6, S. 3, Ca. 16-20. Body stout. Head broad behind,
but with a pointed muzzle. In walking the entire sole not applied
to the ground, as it is when the animal is standing. Toes, especially
of the fore-foot, very free, and capable of being spread wide apart;
claws compressed, curved and pointed. Tail moderately long,
cylindrical, thickly covered with hair, ringed, non-prehensile. Fur
long, thick and soft. The common raccoon (<i>Procyon lotor</i>) of North
America is the type of this genus; it is replaced in South America
by <i>P. cancrivorus</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Raccoon</a></span>). The cacomistles (<i>Bassariscus</i>)
are nearly allied to <i>Procyon</i>, but of more slender and elegant proportions,
with sharper nose, longer tail, and more digitigrade feet, and
teeth smaller and more sharply cusped. The typical <i>B. astuta</i> is
from the southern parts of the United States and Mexico, while <i>B.
(Wagneria) annulata</i> is Mexican and Central American.</p>

<p>The name <i>Bassaricyon</i> has been given to a distinct modification of
the procyonine type of which at present two species are known,
one from Costa Rica and the other from Ecuador respectively,
named <i>B. gabbi</i> and <i>B. alleni</i>. They much resemble the kinkajou
in external appearance, but the skull and teeth are more like those
of <i>Procyon</i> and <i>Nasua</i>. In the coatis, <i>Nasua</i>, the dentition is as in
<i>Procyon</i>, but the upper canines are larger and more strongly compressed,
and the molars smaller; while the facial portion of the
skull is more elongated and narrow. Vertebrae: C. 7, D. 14, L. 6,
S. 3, Ca. 22-23. Body elongated and rather compressed. Nose
prolonged into a somewhat upturned, obliquely-truncated, mobile
snout. Tail long, non-prehensile, tapering and ringed. Coatis, or
coati-mundis, live in small troops of eight to twenty, are chiefly
arboreal, and feed on fruits, young birds, eggs, insects, &amp;c. The
two best-known species are <i>N. narica</i> of Mexico and Central America,
and <i>N. rufa</i> of South America from Surinam to Paraguay (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Coati</a></span>).</p>

<p>In the kinkajou (<i>q.v.</i>), an animal long known as <i>Cercoleptes caudivolvulus</i>,
but whose designation it has been proposed to change to
the unclassical <i>Potos flavus</i>, the dentition is i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, m. <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span> = 36.
Molars with low flat crowns, very obscurely tuberculated. Skull
short and rounded, with flat upper surface. Vertebrae: C. 7, D. 14,
L. 6, S. 3, Ca. 26-28. Clavicles present, but in a very rudimentary
condition. Head broad and round. Ears short. Body long and
musteline. Limbs short. Tail long, tapering and prehensile. Fur
short and soft. Tongue long and very extensile.</p>

<p>The last existing family of the land Carnivora is that typified
by the martens and weasels, and hence known as the <i>Mustelidae</i>.
The group is characterized by the absence of an alisphenoid
canal in the skull, the reduction of the molars to ½ or even
<span class="sidenote">Weasel tribe.</span>
<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, the medium size of the sectorial tooth in each jaw, the
absence or presence of a perforation in the humerus, and the presence
of anal glands. The family is cosmopolitan in distribution, with the
exception of Australasia and Madagascar.</p>

<p>The first section of the family, forming the subfamily <i>Mustelinae</i>,
is typically characterized by the short and partially webbed toes,
furnished with short, compressed, sharp, curved and often partially
retractile claws. The upper molar is always of moderate size and
elongated in the transverse direction. In the martens and sables
(<i>Mustela</i>) the dentition is i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, m. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>; total 38; the upper
sectorial having its inner lobe close to the anterior edge of the
tooth; and the upper molar being nearly as large as the sectorial.
Lower sectorial with small inner tubercle. Vertebrae: C. 7, D. 14,
L. 6, S. 3, Ca. 18-23. Body long and slender. Limbs short, partially
digitigrade, with the feet rounded and the toes short, with compressed,
acute, semi-retractile claws. Tail moderate or long, more
or less bushy. One species, <i>M. martes</i>, the pine-marten, is British;
the remainder inhabit the northern regions of Europe, Asia and
America. Many of the species, as the sable (<i>M. zibellina</i>), yield fur
of great value (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Marten</a></span>).</p>

<p>The dentition of <i>Putorius</i> differs from that of <i>Mustela</i> chiefly in
the absence of the anterior premolars of both jaws. The teeth are
more sharply cusped, and the lower sectorial wants the inner tubercle.
External characters generally similar to those of the martens, but
the body longer and more slender, and the limbs even shorter. All
the species are small animals, of active, bloodthirsty and courageous
disposition, living chiefly on birds and small mammals, and rather
terrestrial than arboreal, dwelling among rocks, stones and out-buildings.
Some of the species, as the stoat or ermine (<i>P. ermineus</i>),
inhabiting cold climates, undergo a seasonal change of colour, being
brown in summer and white in winter, though the change does
not affect the whole of the fur, the end of the tail remaining
black in all seasons. This is a large genus, having a very extensive
geographical range throughout the Old and New Worlds, and
includes the animals commonly known as weasels, polecats, ferrets
and minks (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p>In the glutton (<i>Gulo luscus</i>) the dentition is i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>, m. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>;
total 38; the crowns of the teeth being stout, and the upper molar
much smaller than the sectorial. Lower sectorial large, with small
heel and no inner tubercle. The dentition, though really but a
modification of that of the weasels, presents a general resemblance
to that of hyena. Vertebrae: C. 7, D. 15, L. 5, S. 3, Ca. 15. Body
and limbs stoutly made; feet large and powerful, subplantigrade,
with large, compressed, much-curved and sharp-pointed claws.
Soles of the feet (except the pads of the toes) covered with thick
bristly hairs. Ears very small, nearly concealed by the fur. Eyes
small. Tail short, thick and bushy. Fur full, long and rather
coarse. The one species, the wolverine or glutton, is an inhabitant
of the forest regions of northern Europe, Asia and America, and much
resembles a small bear in appearance. It is a very powerful animal
for its size, climbs trees and lives on squirrels, hares, beavers,
reindeer, and is said to attack even horses and cows.</p>

<p>The South American grison and tayra represent the genus <i>Galictis</i>,
in which the dentition is i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, m. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>; total 34; the molars
being small but stout, and the upper sectorial with the inner lobe
near the middle of the inner border. Lower sectorial with heel
small, and inner tubercle small or absent. Body long; limbs short,
with non-retractile claws and naked soles. Head broad and
depressed. Tail of moderate length. The species include the
grison (<i>G. vittata</i>), <i>G. allamandi</i>, and the tayra (<i>G. barbara</i>); the
last, which extends northward into Central America, being sub-generically
separated as <i>Galera</i>. Nearly allied to these is the smaller
and more weasel-like <i>Lyncodon patagonicus</i>. All the foregoing
South American carnivores display a marked tendency to being
darker on the lower than on the upper surface. The same feature
obtains in the African and Indian ratels, or honey-badgers, constituting
the genus <i>Mellivora</i>, distinguished from all the other
members of the family by having only a single pair of lower molars,
the dentition being i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, m. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>; total 32; the upper sectorial
is large, with its inner cusp at the anterior end of the blade, the molar
much smaller and transversely extended, having a small outer and
a larger rounded inner lobe. Heel of lower sectorial very small,
scarcely one-fourth of the whole length of the tooth, with but one
cusp. Vertebrae: C. 7, D. 14, L. 4, S. 4, Ca. 15. Body stout,
depressed; limbs short, strong; head depressed; nose rather
pointed; ears rudimentary. Tail short. <i>M. indica</i>, from India,
and <i>M. ratel</i>, from south and west Africa, have nearly the same
general appearance and size, being rather larger than a common
badger, and may be only races of the same species. Their coloration
is peculiar, all the upper surface of the body, head and tail being
ash-grey, while the lower parts, separated by a distinct longitudinal
boundary line, are black. They live chiefly on the ground, into
which they burrow, but can also climb trees. They feed on small
mammals, birds, reptiles and insects, and are partial to honey.</p>

<p>In the Indo-Malay ferret-badger, <i>Helictis</i>, the dentition is i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>,
p. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>, m. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>; total 38. Upper sectorial with a large bicusped inner
lobe, molar smaller, wider transversely than in the antero-posterior
direction. Lower sectorial with heel about one-third the length of
the tooth. Skull elongated, rather narrow and depressed; facial
portion especially narrow; infraorbital foramen very large. Head
rather small and produced in front, with an elongated, obliquely
truncated, naked snout and small ears. Body elongated, limbs
short. Tail short or moderate, bushy. Several species are described,
such as <i>H. orientalis, moschata, nipalensis</i>, and <i>subaurantiaca</i>, from
eastern Asia, all small animals, climbing trees with agility and living
on fruits and berries as well as on small mammals and birds.</p>

<p>The African striped zorilles, or <i>Muis-honds</i> (<i>Ictonyx</i>), have a
dental formula of i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, m. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>; total 34; the teeth much
resembling those of the polecats, and the upper molar being smaller
than the sectorial, and narrow from before backwards. Lower
sectorial with a smalt narrow heel and distinct inner tubercle.
General form of body musteline. Limbs short, fore-feet large and
broad, with five stout, nearly straight, blunt and non-retractile
claws, of which the first and fifth are considerably shorter than the
others. Tail moderate, with longer hairs towards the end, giving it
a bushy appearance. Hair generally long and loose. The best-known
species of this genus, the Cape polecat, <i>Ictonyx capensis</i>
(or <i>Zorilla zorilla</i>), is about the size of a polecat, but conspicuous
by its broad, longitudinal bands of dark-brown, alternating with
white. Its odour is said to be as offensive as that of the American
skunks. From the Cape of Good Hope it ranges as far north as
Senegal. Another species, <i>I. lybicus</i>, from Sennaar, has been described.
The small striped polecat of southern Africa, <i>Poecilogale albinucha</i>,
represents a genus by itself, and is a shorter-haired animal.</p>

<p>The skunks of America are very similar to the two genera last
mentioned in their colouring, and with the latter serve to form a
connecting link with the more typical <i>Mustelinae</i>, and the badger
group, or <i>Melinae</i>, in which the feet are elongated, with straight toes
and non-retractile, slightly curved, subcompressed, blunt claws,
especially large on the fore-foot. In all cases the upper molar is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page374" id="page374"></a>374</span>
larger than the sectorial, and in the more typical genera is much
longer than broad.</p>

<p>In the North American skunks of the genus <i>Mephitis</i> the dentition
is i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, m. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>; total 34. Upper molar larger than the
sectorial, subquadrate, rather broader than long; lower sectorial
with heel less than half the length of the whole tooth. Bony
palate terminating posteriorly opposite the hinder border of the
last molar. Facial portion of skull short and somewhat truncated
in front. Vertebrae: C. 7, D. 16, L. 6, S. 2, Ca. 21. Head small.
Body elongated. Limbs moderate, subplantigrade. Ears short and
rounded. Tail long, abundantly clothed with long fine hair. Anal
glands largely developed; their secretion, which can be discharged
at the will of the animal, has an intolerably offensive odour and has
rendered skunks proverbial. The South American species, which
have only two upper premolars, and differ in some other characters,
are generically separated under the name of <i>Conepatus</i>; while the
small North American arboreal skunks are distinguished as <i>Spilogale</i>
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Skunk</a></span>).</p>

<p>Passing on to the more typical members of the badger group, we
have first the genus <i>Arctonyx</i>, with the dentition i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>, m. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>;
total 38. The incisor line is curved, the outer teeth being
placed posteriorly to the others: lower incisors inclined
<span class="sidenote">Badger tribe.</span>
forwards. First premolars often rudimentary or absent;
upper molar much larger than the sectorial, longer in the antero-posterior
direction than broad; lower sectorial with a very large,
low, tuberculated heel. Skull elongated and depressed; face long,
narrow and concave above; bony palate extending as far backwards
as the level of the glenoid fossa; and palatal bones dilated.
Suborbital foramina very large. Vertebrae: C. 7, D. 16, L. 4, S. 4,
Ca. 20. Snout long, naked, mobile and truncated, with large
terminal nostrils, much like those of a pig. Eyes small; ears very
small and rounded. Body compressed, rather than depressed.
Limbs of moderate length, and partially digitigrade in walking.
Tail moderate, tapering. A full soft under-fur, with longer bristly
hairs interspersed. The longest-known species is <i>A. collaris</i>,
the <i>bhalu-soor</i> (bear-pig) or <i>bali-soor</i> (sand-pig) of the natives of the
mountains of north-eastern India, Burma and Borneo. It is rather
larger than the badger, higher on its legs, and very pig-like in general
aspect, of a light grey colour, with flesh-coloured snout and feet;
nocturnal and omnivorous. Other species or local varieties have been
described from north China and Burma.</p>

<p>In the genus <i>Mydaus</i> the dentition is as the last, but the cusps of
the teeth are more acutely pointed. Skull elongated, face narrow
and produced. Suborbital foramen small, and the palate, as in all
the succeeding genera of this group, produced backwards about
midway between the last molar and the glenoid fossa. Vertebrae:
C. 7, D. 14-15, L. 6-5, S. 3, Ca. 12. Head pointed in front; snout
produced, mobile, obliquely truncated, the nostrils being inferior.
Limbs rather short and stout. Tail extremely short, but clothed
with rather long bushy hair. Anal glands largely developed, and
emitting an odour like that of the skunks. One species, <i>M. meliceps</i>,
the teledu, a small burrowing animal from the mountains of Java,
at an elevation of 7000 or more ft. above the sea-level; and a second
(<i>M. marchei</i>) from the Philippines.</p>

<p>In the true badger of the genus <i>Meles</i> the dentition is i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>,
p. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>, m. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>; total 38. The first premolar in both jaws is extremely
minute and often deciduous; while the upper molar is much larger
than the sectorial, subquadrate, and as broad as long. Lower
sectorial with a broad, low, tuberculated heel, more than half the
length of the whole tooth. The postglenoid process of the skull so
strongly developed, and the glenoid fossa so deep, that the condyle of
the lower jaw is firmly held in place after the soft parts are removed.
Vertebrae: C. 7, D. 15, L. 5, S, 3, Ca. 18. Muzzle pointed. Ears
very short. Body stout, broad. Limbs short, strong, subplantigrade.
Tail short. Typified by the common badger (<i>M. taxus</i> or
<i>M. meles</i>) of Europe and northern Asia, still found in many parts of
England, where it lives in woods, is nocturnal, burrowing and very
omnivorous, feeding on mice, reptiles, insects, fruit, acorns and
roots. Other nearly allied species, <i>M. leucurus</i> and <i>M. chinensis</i>,
are found in continental Asia, and <i>M. anakuma</i> in Japan.</p>

<p>In the nearly-allied genus <i>Taxidea</i> the dental formula is as in
<i>Meles</i>, except that the rudimentary anterior premolars appear to be
always wanting in the upper jaw. The upper sectorial is much larger
in proportion to the other teeth; and the upper molar about the
same size as the sectorial, triangular, with the apex turned backwards.
Heel of lower sectorial less than half the length of the tooth.
Skull very wide in the occipital region; the lambdoidal crest greatly
developed, and the sagittal but slightly, contrary to what obtains in
<i>Meles.</i> Vertebrae: C. 7. D. 15. L. 5, S. 3, Ca. (?). Body stoutly
built and depressed. Tail short. The animals of this genus are
peculiar to North America, where they represent the badgers of the
Old World, resembling them much in appearance and habits. <i>T.
americana</i> is the common American badger of the United States,
<i>T. berlandieri</i>, the Mexican badger, being a local variety.</p>

<p>The third and last subfamily is that of the otters, or <i>Lutrinae</i>,
in which the feet (with the exception of the hind pair in the sea-otter)
are short and rounded, with the toes webbed, and the
claws small, curved and blunt. The head is broad and
<span class="sidenote">Otter tribe.</span>
much depressed. The upper posterior cheek-teeth are
large and quadrate. The kidneys are conglomerate. Habits aquatic.</p>

<p>In the true otter of the genus <i>Lutra</i> the dentition is i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>,
p. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, m. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>; total 36. Upper sectorial with a trenchant tricusped
blade, and a very large inner lobe, hollowed on the free surface,
with a raised sharp edge, extending along two-thirds or more of the
length of the blade. Upper molar large, with a quadricuspidate
crown, broader than long. Skull broad and depressed, contracted
immediately behind the orbits; with the facial portion very short and
the brain-case large. Vertebrae: C. 7, D. 14-15, L. 6-5, S. 3, Ca. 20-26.
Body very long. Ears short and rounded. Limbs short. Feet completely
webbed, with well-developed claws on all the toes. Tail long,
thick at the base and tapering, rather depressed. Fur short and close.</p>

<p>Otters are more or less aquatic, living on the margins of rivers,
lakes, and in some cases the sea; are expert divers and swimmers,
and feed chiefly on fish. They have an extensive geographical range,
and so much resemble each other in outward appearance, especially
in the nearly uniform brown colouring, that in some cases the species
are by no means well-defined. The Brazilian otter (<i>L. brasiliensis</i>)
is a very large species from Brazil, Demerara and Surinam, with
a prominent ridge along each lateral margin of the tail. In two
small species the feet are only slightly webbed; claws exceedingly
small or altogether wanting on some of the toes; the first upper
premolar very small, sometimes wanting; and the molars very
broad and massive. The species in question are <i>L. inunguis</i> of
South Africa, and <i>L. leptonyx</i> or <i>cinerea</i> of India, Java and Sumatra,
and have been separated as a distinct genus, Aonyx.</p>

<p>The sea-otter, <i>Latax</i> (or <i>Enhydra</i>) <i>lutra</i>, with a dentition of
i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, m. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>, total 32, differs from other Carnivora in having but
two incisors on each side of the lower jaw, the one corresponding to the
first (very small in the true otters) being absent. Though the molar
teeth generally resemble those of <i>Lutra</i> in their proportions, they
differ in the exceeding roundness and massiveness of their crowns
and bluntness of their cusps. Feet webbed; fore-feet short, with
five subequal toes, with short compressed claws; hind-feet very
large, depressed and fin-like, their phalanges flattened as in seals.
The fifth toe the longest and stoutest, the rest gradually diminishing
in size to the first, all with moderate claws. Tail moderate, cylindrical
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Otter</a></span>).</p>
</div>

<p class="center pt2 sc">II. Pinnipedia</p>

<p>The second suborder is formed by the seals, walruses and
eared seals, which differ from the rest of the Carnivora mainly
in the limbs being modified for aquatic progression; the two
upper segments being very short and partially enveloped in
the general integument of the body, while the third, especially
in the hind extremities, is elongated, expanded and webbed.
There are always five well-developed digits on each limb. In
the hind-limb the two marginal digits (first and fifth) are stouter
and generally larger than the others. The teeth also differ from
those of the more typical Carnivora. The incisors are always
fewer than <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>. The chsek series consists generally of four premolars
and one molar of uniform characters, with never more
than two roots, and with conical, more or less compressed,
pointed crowns, which may have accessory cusps, placed before
or behind the principal one, but are never broad and tuberculated.
The milk-teeth are small, simple and shed or absorbed
at an early age, usually either before or within a few days after
birth. The brain is relatively large, the cerebral hemispheres
broad in proportion to their length, and with numerous and
complex convolutions. There is a very short caecum; the
kidneys are divided into numerous distinct lobules. There
are no Cowper&rsquo;s glands. Teats two or four, abdominal. No
clavicles. Tail always short. Eyes large and exposed, with
flat cornea. The nostrils close by the elasticity of their walls,
and are opened at will by muscular action.</p>

<p>The members of this group are aquatic, spending the greater
part of their time in the water, swimming and diving with great
facility, feeding mainly on fish, crustaceans and other marine
animals, and progressing on land with difficulty, but always
coming on shore for the purpose of bringing forth their young.
They are generally marine, but occasionally ascend large rivers,
and some inhabit inland seas and lakes, as the Caspian and
Baikal. Though not numerous in species, they are widely
distributed over the world, but occur most abundantly on the
coasts of lands situated in cold and temperate zones.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Creodonta</a></span>, the true seals (<i>Phocidae</i>),
together with the walruses, may be directly descended from the
primitive Creodont Carnivora. The eared seals, on the other
hand, show signs of affinity with the bears; but as they are
of earlier geological age than the latter, they cannot be derived
from that group.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page375" id="page375"></a>375</span></p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The true seals (family <i>Phocidae</i>) are the most completely adapted
for aquatic life of all the Pinnipedia. When on land the hind-limbs
are extended backwards and take no part in progression,
which is effected by a series of jumping movements
<span class="sidenote">Seals.</span>
produced by the muscles of the trunk, in some species aided by the
fore-limbs. The soles of the feet are hairy. There is no pinna to
the ear, and no scrotum, the testes being abdominal. The upper
incisors have simple, pointed crowns, and vary in number in the
different groups. All have well developed canines and <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span> teeth of the
cheek series. In those species of which the milk-dentition is known,
there are three milk molars, which precede the second, third, and
fourth permanent molars; the dentition is therefore p. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>, m. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>,
the first premolar having as usual no milk predecessor. The skull
has no post-orbital process and no alisphenoid canal. The fur is
stiff and adpressed, without woolly under-fur.</p>

<p>In the typical group, or subfamily <i>Phocinae</i>, the incisors are <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>.
All the feet have five well-developed claws with the toes on the hind-feet
subequal, the first and fifth not greatly exceeding the others
in length, the interdigital membrane not extending beyond them.
In the genus <i>Halichoerus</i> the dentition is i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>, m. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>; total 34.
Molars with large, simple, conical, recurved, slightly compressed
crowns, having sharp anterior and posterior edges, but without
accessory cusps, except sometimes the two hinder ones of the lower
jaw. With the exception of the last one or two in the upper jaw
and the last in the lower jaw, all are single-rooted. Vertebrae:
C. 7, D. 15, L. 5, S. 4, Ca. 14. Includes only one species <i>H. grypus</i>,
the grey seal of the coasts or Scandinavia and the British Isles.</p>

<p>In <i>Phoca</i> the dental formula is as in the last, but the teeth are
smaller and more pointed. Molars with two roots (except the first
in each jaw). Crowns with accessory cusps. Vertebrae: C. 7, D. 14-15,
L. 5, S. 4, Ca. 11-14. Head round and short. Fore-feet short
with five strong, subcompressed, slightly curved, subequal, rather
sharp claws. On the hind-feet the claws much narrower and less
curved. The species of this genus are widely distributed throughout
the northern hemisphere, and include <i>P. barbata</i>, the bearded seal;
<i>P. groenlandica</i>, the Greenland seal; <i>P. vitulina</i>, the common seal;
<i>P. hispida</i>, the ringed seal of the north Atlantic; <i>P. caspica</i>, from
the Caspian and Aral Seas; and <i>P. sibirica</i>, from Lake Baikal. (See
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Seal</a></span>).</p>

<p>The members of the second subfamily, <i>Monachinae</i>, have incisors
<span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>; and the molars two-rooted, except the first. On the hind-feet
the first and fifth toes greatly exceeding the others in length, with
nails rudimentary or absent. In the genus <i>Monachus</i>, the dentition
is i. <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>, m. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>; total 32. Crowns of molars strong, conical,
compressed, hollowed on the inner side, with a strongly-marked
lobed cingulum, especially on the inner side, and slightly developed
accessory cusps before and behind. The first and last upper and
the first lower molar smaller than the others. Vertebrae: C. 7,
D. 15, L. 5, S. 2, Ca. 11. All the nails of both fore and hind feet
very small and rudimentary. Represented by <i>M. albiventer</i>, the
monk-seal of the Mediterranean and adjacent parts of the Atlantic,
and the West Indian <i>M. tropicalis.</i></p>

<p>The other genera of this section have the same dental formula,
but are distinguished by the characters, of the cheek-teeth and the
feet. They are all inhabitants of the shores of the southern
hemisphere.</p>

<p>In <i>Ogmorhinus</i> all the teeth of the cheek-series have three distinct
pointed cusps, deeply separated from each other, of which the
middle or principal cusp is largest and slightly recurved; the other
two are nearly equal in size, and have their tips directed towards the
middle one. Skull much elongated. One species, <i>O. leptonyx</i>, the
sea-leopard, widely distributed in the Antarctic and southern
temperate seas. In <i>Lobodon</i> the molars have compressed elongated
crowns, with a principal recurved cusp, rounded and somewhat
bulbous at the apex, and one anterior, and one, two or three posterior
distinct accessory cusps. One species, <i>L. carcinophagus</i>, the crab-eating
seal. In the third genus, <i>Leptonychotes</i>, represented by
<i>L. weddelli</i>, the molars are small, with simple, subcompressed,
conical crowns, and a broad cingulum, but no distinct accessory
cusps. Finally in the white seal (<i>Ommatophoca rossi</i>) all the teeth
are very small, those of the cheek-series with pointed, recurved
crowns, and small posterior and still less developed anterior accessory
cusps. Orbits very large. Nails rudimentary on front and absent
on hind-feet. The skull bears a considerable resemblance to that
of the next subfamily.</p>

<p>The presence of two pairs of upper and one pair of lower incisors
is characteristic of the members of the subfamily <i>Cystophorinae</i>,
in which the teeth of the cheek-series are generally one-rooted. The
nose of the males has an appendage capable of being inflated. First
and fifth toes of hind-feet greatly exceeding the others in length,
with prolonged cutaneous lobes, and rudimentary or no nails. In
the typical genus <i>Cystophora</i> the dentition is i. <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>, m. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>;
total 30; the last molar having generally two distinct roots. Beneath
the skin over the face of the male, and connected with the nostrils,
is a sac capable of inflation, when it forms a kind of hood covering
the upper part of the head. Nails present, though small on the
hind-feet. Represented by <i>C. cristata</i>, the hooded or bladder-nosed
seal of the Polar Seas. In <i>Macrorhinus</i> the dentition is numerically
the same as in the last, but the molars are of simpler character and
all one-rooted. All the teeth, except the canines, very small relatively
to the size of the animal. Hind-feet without nails. Vertebrae:
C. 7, D. 15, L. 5, S. 4, Ca. 11. Nose of adult male produced into a
short tubular proboscis, ordinarily flaccid, but capable of dilatation
and elongation under excitement. One species, <i>M. leoninus</i>, the
elephant-seal, or &ldquo;sea elephant&rdquo; of the whalers, the largest of the
whole family, attaining the length of nearly 20 ft. Formerly
abundant in the Antarctic Seas, and also found on the coast of
California.</p>

<p>The next family is that of the walruses, or <i>Odobaenidae</i>, the single
generic representative of which is in some respects intermediate
between the <i>Phocidae</i> and <i>Otariidae</i>, but has a completely
aberrant dentition. Walruses have no external ears, as
<span class="sidenote">Walrus</span>
in the <i>Phocidae</i>; but when on land the hind-feet are turned forwards
and used in progression, though less completely than in the <i>Otariidae</i>.
The upper canines are developed into immense tusks, which descend
a long distance below the lower jaw. All the other teeth, including
the lower canines, are much alike, small, simple and one-rooted,
the molars with flat crowns. The skull is without post-orbital
process, but has an alisphenoid canal. In the young the dentition is
i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. and m. <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>, but many of these teeth are, however, lost early
or remain through life in a rudimentary state, concealed by the gums.
The teeth which are usually developed functionally are i. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">0</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>,
p. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, m. <span class="spp">0</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">0</span>; total 18. Vertebrae: C. 7, D. 14, L. 6, S. 4, Ca. 9.
Head round. Eyes rather small. Muzzle short and broad, with a
group of long, very stiff, bristly whiskers on each side. The remainder
of the hair-covering very short and closely pressed. Tail rudimentary.
Fore-feet with subequal toes, carrying five minute
flattened nails. Hind-feet with subequal toes, the fifth slightly the
largest, with cutaneous lobes projecting beyond the ends as in
<i>Otaria</i>; first and fifth with minute flattened nails; second, third
and fourth with large, elongated, subcompressed pointed nails.
The two species are <i>Odobaenus rosmarus</i>, of the Atlantic, and the
closely allied <i>O. obesus</i>, of the Pacific. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Walrus</a></span>.)</p>

<p>The third and last family of the Pinnipedia, and thus of existing
Carnivora, is the <i>Otariidae</i>, which includes the eared seals, or sea-lions
and sea-bears. In all these animals, when on land,
the hind-feet are turned forwards under the body, and
<span class="sidenote">Sea-lions</span>
aid in supporting and moving the trunk as in ordinary quadrupeds.
There are small external ears. Testes suspended in a distinct
external scrotum. Skull with post-orbital processes and alisphenoid
canal. Soles of feet naked. By many naturalists these seals are
arranged in a number of generic groups, but as the differences
between them are not very great, they may all be included in the
typical genus <i>Otaria</i>. The dental formula is i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>, m. <span class="spp">1 or 2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>;
total 34 or 36. The first and second upper incisors are small, with
the summits of their crowns divided by deep transverse grooves
into an anterior and a posterior cusp of nearly equal height; the
third large and canine-like. Canines large, conical, pointed, recurved.
Molars and premolars usually <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span>, of which the second, third and
fourth are preceded by milk-teeth shed a few days after birth;
sometimes (as in fig. 7) a sixth upper molar (occasionally developed
on one side and not the other); all with similar characters, generally
single-rooted; crown moderate, compressed, pointed, with a single
principal cusp, and sometimes a cingulum, and more or less developed
anterior and posterior accessory cusps. Vertebrae: C. 7, D. 15,
L. 5, S. 4, Ca. 9-10. Head rounded. Eyes large; ears small,
narrow and pointed. Neck long. Skin of the feet extended far
beyond the nails and ends of the digits, with a deeply-lobed margin.
The nails small and often quite rudimentary, especially those of
the first and fifth toes of both feet; the best-developed and most
constant being the three middle claws of the hind-foot, which are
elongated, compressed and curved.</p>

<p>Sea-bears and sea-lions are widely distributed, especially in the
temperate regions of both hemispheres, though absent from the
coasts of the North Atlantic. They spend more of their time on
shore, and range inland to greater distances than the true seals,
especially at the breeding-time, though they are obliged to return
to the water to seek their food. They are gregarious and polygamous,
and the males usually much larger than the females. Some
possess, in addition to the stiff, close, hairy covering common to the
group, a fine, dense, woolly under-fur. The skins of these, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page376" id="page376"></a>376</span>
dressed and deprived of the longer harsh outer hairs, constitute the
&ldquo;sealskin&rdquo; of commerce. The species include <i>O. stelleri</i>, the
northern sea-lion, the largest of the genus, from the North Pacific,
about 10 ft. in length; <i>O. jubata</i>, the southern sea-lion, from the
Falkland Islands and Patagonia; <i>O. californiana</i>, from California;
<i>O. ursina</i>, the sea-bear or fur-seal of the North Pacific, the skins of
which are imported in immense numbers from the Pribiloff Islands;
<i>O. antarctica</i> or <i>pusilla</i>, from the Cape of Good Hope; and <i>O.
forsteri</i>, from Australia and various islands in the southern hemisphere.
(See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Seal-Fisheries</a></span>.)</p>

<p>Little is known as to the past history of the sea-lions and sea-bears,
but a skull has been obtained from the Miocene strata of
Oregon, which Mr F.W. True states to be considerably larger than
any existing sea-lion skull; its basal length when entire being
probably about 20 in. The name <i>Pontoleon magnus</i> has been proposed
for this fossil sea-lion, as the character of the skull and teeth
do not agree precisely with those of any living member of the group.
If, however, all the modern eared seals are included in the genus
<i>Otaria</i>, there is apparently no reason to exclude the fossil species.</p>

<p class="center pt2 sc">Extinct Carnivora</p>

<p>Modern Carnivora are undoubtedly the descendants of the
Creodonta (<i>q.v.</i>), an extinct early Tertiary suborder. It has been
observed that as the Miocene is approached, some of these Carnivora
Creodonta, or Primitiva, begin to assume more and more of the
characteristics of the Carnivora Vera, till at last it is difficult to
determine where the one group ends and the other commences.
The creodont genera <i>Stypolophus</i> and <i>Proviverra</i> show some of these
modern characters; but it is not till we reach the European Oligocene
genus <i>Amphictis</i>, with the dental formula i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>, p. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>, m. <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>,
that we meet a type in which the fourth upper premolar and the first
lower molar assume the truly sectorial character of the Carnivora
Vera, while the teeth behind them are proportionally reduced in
size. From the <i>Amphictidae</i> are probably descended the <i>Viverridae</i>,
the connecting genus being the African <i>Nandinia</i>, which, as already
mentioned, retains the imperfectly ossified bulla of the ancestral
forms. In another direction, <i>Amphictis</i>, through the Old World
Lower Pliocene genus <i>Ictitherium</i>, has given rise to the <i>Hyaenidae</i>.
The <i>Felidae</i> have apparently an ancestral type in the creodont
<i>Palaeonictis</i>, which has been regarded as the direct ancestor of
the sabre-toothed cats, or <i>Machaerodontinae</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Machaerodus</a></span>);
but it is possible that <i>Palaeonictis</i> may be off the direct line, and
that the <i>Felidae</i> are sprung from <i>Amphictis</i>. Be this as it may,
from another group of creodonts, represented by <i>Vulpavus</i> (<i>Miacis</i>),
<i>Viverravus</i> (<i>Didymictis</i>), and <i>Uintacyon</i>, is probably derived the
Oligocene <i>Cynodictis</i>, with a dental formula like that of <i>Canis</i> or
<i>Cyon</i>, a perforation to the humerus, and an apparently undivided
auditory bulla; and from <i>Cynodictis</i> the transition is easy to the
<i>Canidae</i>. It should be mentioned, however, that there is a group
of North American Oligocene dog-like animals, such as <i>Daphaenus</i>,
<i>Protemnocyon</i>, and <i>Temnocyon</i>, which agree with <i>Cyon</i> in the shortness
of the jaws, and with that genus and <i>Speothos</i> in the cutting-heel
of the lower sectorial. Possibly these genera may be nearly related
to <i>Cyon</i>. Other dog-like North American types are <i>Oligohinis</i>,
<i>Enhydrocyon</i> and <i>Hyaenocyon</i>.</p>

<p>By means of the <i>Amphicyonidae</i>, as represented by the Middle
Tertiary genera <i>Proamphicyon, Pseudamphicyon</i>, and <i>Amphicyon</i>,
in which there were three upper molars, we have a transition from
the <i>Cynodictis</i>-type to the bear-group; one of the later intermediate
forms being the Lower Pliocene Old World <i>Hyaenarctus</i>, in which
the two upper molars are squared and foreshadow those of <i>Ursus</i>
itself. In some unknown manner <i>Hyaenarctus</i> appears to be related
to <i>Aeluropus</i>. An allied type is found in <i>Arctotherium</i> of the South
American Pleistocene.</p>

<p>By the loss of the third lower molar and certain modifications of
the other teeth and skull, the Miocene genus <i>Plesictis</i> may be derived
from <i>Cynodictis</i>, its dental formula being i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>, m. <span class="spp">1 or 2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>.
Now <i>Plesictis</i> is nothing more than a generalized representative of
the <i>Mustelidae</i>. We have thus traced three out of the four modern
arctoid families to the <i>Cynodictis</i>-type. The <i>Procyonidae</i>, or fourth
family (apart from the Asiatic <i>Aelurus</i> and <i>Aeluropus</i>) are connected
with the last-named genus through the North American Oligocene
<i>Phlaeocyon</i>, which is stated to be in almost every respect intermediate
between <i>Procyon</i> and <i>Cynodictis</i> while the living <i>Bassariscus</i>
is stated to show closer signs of affinity with <i>Cynodictis</i>
than with <i>Phlaeocyon</i>.</p>

<p>To deal with fossil representatives of living genera, or extinct
genera nearly related to groups still existing, would here be impracticable.
It may be stated, however, that aberrant groups like
the otters are linked up with more normal types by means of extinct
forms (in this particular instance by the Miocene <i>Potamotherium</i>),
so that the gaps in the phylogeny of the Carnivora are comparatively
few.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARNOT, LAZARE HIPPOLYTE<a name="ar8" id="ar8"></a></span> (1801-1888), French statesman,
the second son of L.N.M. Carnot (<i>q.v.</i>), was born at Saint-Omer
on the 6th of October 1801. Hippolyte Carnot lived at
first in exile with his father, returning to France only in 1823.
Unable then to enter active political life, he turned to literature
and philosophy, publishing in 1828 a collection of <i>Chants helléniques</i>
translated from the German of W. Müller, and in 1830 an
<i>Exposé de la doctrine Saint-Simonienne</i>, and collaborating in
the Saint-Simonian journal <i>Le Producteur.</i> He also paid several
visits to England and travelled in other countries of Europe.
In March 1839, after the dissolution of the chamber by Louis
Philippe, he was elected deputy for Paris (re-elected in 1842
and in 1846), and sat in the group of the Radical Left, being
one of the leaders of the party hostile to Louis Philippe. On the
24th of February 1848 he pronounced in favour of the republic.
Lamartine chose him as minister of education in the provisional
government, Carnot set to work to organize the primary school
systems, proposing a law for obligatory and free primary instruction,
and another for the secondary education of girls.
But he declared himself against purely secular schools, holding
that &ldquo;the minister and the schoolmaster are the two columns
on which rests the edifice of the republic.&rdquo; By this attitude he
alienated both the Right and the Republicans of the Extreme
Left, and was forced to resign on the 5th of July 1848. He was
one of those who protested against the <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> of the 2nd of
December 1851, but was not proscribed by Louis Napoleon.
He refused to sit in the <i>Corps Législatif</i> until 1864, in order not
to have to take the oath to the emperor. From 1864 to 1869
he was in the republican opposition, taking a very active part.
He was defeated at the election of 1869. On the 8th of February
1871 he was named deputy for the Seine et Oise, and participated
in the drawing up of the Constitutional Laws of 1875. On the
16th of December 1875, he was named by the National Assembly
senator for life. He died on the 16th of March 1888, three
months after the election of his elder son, M.F.S. Carnot (<i>q.v.</i>),
to the presidency of the republic. He had published <i>Le Ministère
de l&rsquo;instruction publique et des cultes du 24e février au 5e juillet 1848</i>,
(1849), <i>Mémoires sur Lazare Carnot</i> (2 vols., 1861-1864), <i>Mémoires
de Barère</i> (with David Angers, 4 vols., 1842-1843). His second
son, Marie Adolphe Carnot (b. 1839), became a distinguished
mining-engineer and director of the École des Mines (1899),
his studies in analytical chemistry placing him in the front rank
of French scientists. He was made a member of the Academy
of Sciences in 1895.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARNOT, LAZARE NICOLAS MARGUERITE<a name="ar9" id="ar9"></a></span> (1753-1823),
French general, was born at Nolay in Burgundy in 1753. He
received his training as an engineer at Mézières, becoming an
officer of the Corps de Génie in 1773 and a captain ten years
later. He had then just published his first work, an <i>Essai sur les
machines en général</i>. In 1784 he wrote an essay on balloons, and
his. <i>Éloge</i> of Vauban, read by him publicly, won him the commendation
of Prince Henry of Prussia. But as the result of a
controversy with Montalembert, Carnot abandoned the official,
or Vauban, theories of the art of fortification, and went over to
the &ldquo;perpendicular&rdquo; school of Montalembert. He was consequently
imprisoned, on the pretext of having fought a duel,
and only released when selected to accompany Prince Henry
of Prussia in a visit to Vauban&rsquo;s fortifications. In 1791 he
married. The Revolution drew him into political life, and he
was elected a deputy for the Pas de Calais. In the Assembly he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page377" id="page377"></a>377</span>
took a prominent part in debates connected with the army.
Carnot was a stern and sincere republican, and voted for the
execution of the king. In the campaigns of 1792 and 1793 he
was continually employed as a commissioner in military matters,
his greatest service being in April 1793 on the north-eastern
frontier, where the disastrous battle of Neerwinden and the
subsequent defection of Dumouriez had thrown everything into
confusion. After doing what was possible to infuse energy into
the operations of the French forces, he returned to Paris and
was made a member of the Committee of Public Safety. He was
charged with duties corresponding to those of the modern chief
of the general staff and adjutant-general. As a member of the
committee he signed its decrees and was thus at least technically
responsible for the acts of the Reign of Terror. His energies
were, however, directed to the organization, not yet of victory,
but of defence. His labours were incessant; practically every
military document in the archives of the committee was Carnot&rsquo;s
own work, and he was repeatedly in the field with the armies.
His part in Jourdan&rsquo;s great victory at Wattignies was so important
that the credit of the day has often been assigned to
Carnot. The winter of 1793-1794 was spent in new preparations,
in instituting a severe discipline in the new and ill-trained troops
of the republic, and in improvising means and material of war.
He continued to visit the armies at the front, and to inspire them
with energy. He acquiesced in the fall of Robespierre in 1794,
but later defended Barère and others among his colleagues,
declaring that he himself had constantly signed papers without
reading them, as it was physically impossible to do so in the
press of business. When Carnot&rsquo;s arrest was demanded in May
1795, a deputy cried &ldquo;Will you dare to lay hands on the man
who has organized victory?&rdquo; Carnot had just accepted promotion
to the rank of major in the engineers. Throughout 1793,
when he had been the soul of the national defence, and 1794, in
which year he had &ldquo;organized victory&rdquo; in fourteen armies, he
was a simple captain.</p>

<p>Carnot was elected one of the five Directors in November 1795,
and continued to direct the war department during the campaign
of 1796. Late in 1796 he was made a member (1st class) of the
Institute, which he had helped to establish. He was for two
periods president of the Directory, but on the <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> of the
18th Fructidor (1797) was forced to take refuge abroad. He
returned to France after the 18th Brumaire (1799) and was
re-elected to the Institute in 1800. Early in 1800 he became
minister of war, and he accompanied Moreau in the early part
of the Rhine campaign. His chief work was, however, in reducing
the expenses of the armies. Contrary to the usual custom he
refused to receive presents from contractors, and he effected
much-needed reforms in every part of the military administration.
He tendered his resignation later in the year, but it was
long before the First Consul would accept it. From 1801 he
lived in retirement with his family, employing himself chiefly
in scientific pursuits. As a senator he consistently opposed the
increasing monarchism of Napoleon, who, however, gave him
in 1809 a pension and commissioned him to write a work on
fortification for the school of Metz. In these years he had
published <i>De la corrélation des figures de géométrie</i> (1801), <i>Géométrie
de position</i> (1803), and <i>Principes fondamentaux de l&rsquo;équilibre
et du mouvement</i> (1803), all of which were translated into German.
His great work on fortification appeared at Paris in 1810 (<i>De la
défense de places fortes</i>) and was translated for the use of almost
every army in Europe. He took Montalembert as his ground-work.
Without sharing Montalembert&rsquo;s antipathy to the bastioned
trace, and his predilection for high masonry caponiers,
he followed out the principle of retarding the development of
the attack, and provided for the most active defence. To
facilitate sorties in great force he did away with a counterscarp
wall, providing instead a long gentle slope from the bottom of
the ditch to the crest of the glacis. This, he imagined, would
compel an assailant to maintain large forces in the advanced
trenches, which he proposed to attack by vertical fire from
mortars. Along the front of his fortress was built a heavy
detached wall, loop-holed for fire, and sufficiently high to be a
most formidable obstacle. This &ldquo;Carnot wall,&rdquo; and, in general,
Carnot&rsquo;s principle of active defence, played a great part in the
rise of modern fortification.</p>

<p>He did not seek employment in the field in the aggressive wars
of Napoleon, remaining a sincere republican, but in 1814, when
France itself was once more in danger, Carnot at once offered
his services. He was made a general of division, and Napoleon
sent him to the important fortress of Antwerp as governor.
His defence of that place was one of the most brilliant episodes
of the campaign of 1814. On his return to Paris he addressed
a political memoir to the restored king of France, which aroused
much attention both in France and abroad. He joined Napoleon
during the Hundred Days and was made minister of the interior,
the office carrying with it the dignity of count, and on the 2nd of
June he was made a peer of France. On the second Restoration
he was proscribed. He lived thenceforward in Magdeburg,
occupying himself still with science. But his health rapidly
declined, and he died at Magdeburg on the 2nd of August 1823.
His remains were solemnly removed to the Panthéon in 1889.
Long before this, in 1836, Antwerp had erected a statue to its
defender of 1814. In 1837 Arago pronounced his <i>éloge</i> before
the Académie des Sciences. The sincerity of his patriotism and
his political convictions was proved in 1801-1804 and in 1814.
The memory of his military career is preserved in the title, given
to him in the Assembly, of &ldquo;The organizer of victory.&rdquo; His
sons, Sadi and L. Hippolyte, are separately noticed.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CARNOT, MARIE FRANÇOIS SADI<a name="ar10" id="ar10"></a></span> (1837-1894), fourth
president of the third French Republic, son of L. Hippolyte
Carnot, was born at Limoges on the 11th of August 1837. He
was educated as a civil engineer, and after having highly distinguished
himself at the École Polytechnique and the École
des Ponts et Chaussées, obtained an appointment in the public
service. His hereditary republicanism recommended him to the
government of national defence, by which he was entrusted in
1870 with the task of organizing resistance in the departments
of the Eure, Calvados and Seine Inférieure, and made prefect
of the last named in January 1871. In the following month
he was elected to the National Assembly by the department
Côte d&rsquo;Or. In August 1878 he was appointed secretary to the
minister of public works. In September 1880 he became minister,
and again in April 1885, passing almost immediately to the
ministry of finance, which he held under both the Ferry and
the Freycinet administrations until December 1886. When the
Wilson scandals occasioned the downfall of Grévy in December
1887, Carnot&rsquo;s high character for integrity marked him out as
a candidate for the presidency, and he obtained the support of
Clémenceau and of all those who objected to the candidatures
of men who have been more active in the political arena, so that
he was elected by 616 votes out of 827. He assumed office at a
critical period, when the republic was all but openly attacked
by General Boulanger. President Carnot&rsquo;s ostensible part during
this agitation was mainly confined to augmenting his popularity
by well-timed appearances on public occasions, which gained
credit for the presidency and the republic. When early in 1889,
Boulanger was finally driven into exile, it fell to President
Carnot&rsquo;s lot to appear at the head of the state on two occasions
of especial interest, the celebration of the centenary of 1789
and the opening of the Paris Exhibition of that year. The
perfect success of both was regarded, not unreasonably, as a
popular ratification of the republic, and though continually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id="page378"></a>378</span>
harassed by the formation and dissolution of ephemeral ministries,
by socialist outbreaks, and the beginnings of anti-Semitism,
Carnot had but one serious crisis to surmount, the Panama
scandals of 1892, which, if they greatly damaged the prestige
of the state, increased the respect felt for its head, against whose
integrity none could breathe a word. Carnot seemed to be
arriving at the zenith of popularity, when on the 24th of June
1894, after delivering at a public banquet at Lyons a speech
in which he appeared to imply that he nevertheless would not
seek re-election, he was stabbed by an Italian anarchist named
Caserio and expired almost immediately. The horror and grief
excited by this tragedy were boundless, and the president was
honoured with a splendid funeral in the Panthéon, Paris.</p>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">François Carnot</span>, was first elected deputy for the
Cote d&rsquo;Or in 1902.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARNOT, SADI NICOLAS LÉONHARD<a name="ar11" id="ar11"></a></span> (1796-1832), French
physicist, elder son of L.N.M. Carnot, was born at Paris on the
1st of June 1796. He was admitted to the École Polytechnique
in 1812, and late in 1814 he left with a commission in the
Engineers and with prospects of rapid advancement in his
profession. But Waterloo and the Restoration led to a second
and final proscription of his father; and though not himself
cashiered, Sadi was purposely told off for the merest drudgeries
of his service. Disgusted with an employment which afforded
him neither leisure for original work nor opportunities for acquiring
scientific instruction, he presented himself in 1819 at the
examination for admission to the staff corps (<i>état-major</i>) and
obtained a lieutenancy. He then devoted himself with astonishing
ardour to mathematics, chemistry, natural history, technology
and even political economy. He was an enthusiast in
music and other fine arts; and he habitually practised as an
amusement, while deeply studying in theory, all sorts of athletic
sports, including swimming and fencing. He became captain
in the Engineers in 1827, but left the service altogether in the
following year. His naturally feeble constitution, further
weakened by excessive study, broke down finally in 1832. An
attack of scarlatina led to brain fever, and he had scarcely
recovered when he fell a victim to cholera, of which he died in
Paris on the 24th of August 1832. He was one of the most
original and profound thinkers who have ever devoted themselves
to science. The only work he published was his <i>Réflexions
sur la puissance motrice du feu et sur les machines propres à
développer cette puissance</i> (Paris, 1824). This contains but a
fragment of his scientific discoveries, but it is sufficient to put
him in the very foremost rank, though its full value was not
recognized until pointed out by Lord Kelvin in 1848 and 1849.
Fortunately his manuscripts had been preserved, and extracts
were appended to a reprint of his <i>Puissance motrice</i> by his brother,
L.H. Carnot, in 1878. These show that he had not only realized
for himself the true nature of heat, but had noted down for trial
many of the best modern methods of finding its mechanical
equivalent, such as those of J.P. Joule with the perforated
piston and with the friction of water and mercury. Lord Kelvin&rsquo;s
experiment with a current of gas forced through a porous plug
is also given. &ldquo;Carnot&rsquo;s principle&rdquo; is fundamental in the theory
of thermodynamics (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

fortress, originally belonging to Noricum, but after the 1st
century <span class="sc">a.d.</span> to Pannonia. It was a Celtic town, the name,
which is nearly always found with K on monuments, being
derived from <i>Kar, Karn</i> (&ldquo;rock,&rdquo; &ldquo;cairn&rdquo;). Its extensive
ruins may still be seen near Hainburg, between Deutsch-Altenburg
and Petronell, in lower Austria. Its name first occurs in
history during the reign of Augustus (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 6), when Tiberius
made it his base of operations in the campaigns against Maroboduus
(Marbod). A few years later it became the centre of the
Roman fortifications along the Danube from Vindobona (Vienna)
to Brigetio (O-Szöny), and (under Trajan or Hadrian) the
permanent quarters of the XIV legion. It was also a very old
mart for the amber brought to Italy from the north. It was
created a municipium by Hadrian (Aelium Carnuntum).
Marcus Aurelius resided there for three years (172-175) during
the war against the Marcomanni, and wrote part of his <i>Meditations</i>.
Septimius Severus, at the time governor of Pannonia,
was proclaimed emperor there by the soldiers (193). In the
4th century it was destroyed by the Germans, and, although
partly restored by Valentinian I., it never regained its former
importance, and Vindobona became the chief military centre.
It was finally destroyed by the Hungarians in the middle ages.</p>

a Celtic people of central Gaul, between the Sequana (Seine)
and the Liger (Loire). Their territory corresponded to the
dioceses of Chartres, Orléans and Blois, that is, the greater part
of the modern departments of Eure-et-Loir, Loiret, Loir-et-Cher.
It was regarded as the political and religious centre of the Gallic
nation. The chief towns were Cenabum (not Genabum; Orléans)
and Autricum (Chartres). According to Livy (v. 34) the Carnutes
were one of the tribes which accompanied Bellovesus in his
invasion of Italy during the reign of Tarquinius Priscus. In
the time of Caesar they were dependents of the Remi, who on one
occasion interceded for them. In 52 they joined in the rebellion
of Vercingetorix. As a punishment for the treacherous murder
of some Roman merchants and one of Caesar&rsquo;s commissariat
officers at Cenabum, the town was burnt and the inhabitants
put to the sword or sold as slaves. During the war they sent
12,000 men to relieve Alesia, but shared in the defeat of the
Gallic army. Having attacked the Bituriges Cubi, who appealed
to Caesar for assistance, they were forced to submit. Under
Augustus, the Carnutes, as one of the peoples of Lugdunensis,
were raised to the rank of <i>civitas socia</i> or <i>foederata</i>, retaining
their own institutions, and only bound to render military service
to the emperor. Up to the 3rd century Autricum (later Carnutes,
whence Chartres) was the capital, but in 275 Aurelian changed
Cenabum from a <i>vicus</i> into a <i>civitas</i> and named it Aurelianum
or Aurelianensis urbs (whence Orléans).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARO, ANNIBALE<a name="ar15" id="ar15"></a></span> (1507-1566), Italian poet, was born at
Civita Nuova, in Ancona, in 1507. He became tutor in the
family of Lodovico Gaddi, a rich Florentine, and then secretary
to his brother Giovanni, by whom he was presented to a valuable
ecclesiastical preferment at Rome. At Gaddi&rsquo;s death, he entered
the service of the Farnese family, and became confidential
secretary in succession to Pietro Lodovico, duke of Parma, and
to his sons, duke Ottavio and cardinals Ranuccio and Alexander.
Caro&rsquo;s most important work was his translation of the <i>Aeneid</i>
(Venice, 1581; Paris, 1760). He is also the author of <i>Rime,
Canzoni</i>, and sonnets, a comedy named <i>Gli Straccioni</i>, and two
clever <i>jeux d&rsquo;esprit</i>, one in praise of figs, <i>La Ficheide</i>, and another
in eulogy of the big nose of Leoni Ancona, president of the
Academia della Vertu. Caro&rsquo;s poetry is distinguished by very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page379" id="page379"></a>379</span>
considerable ability, and particularly by the freedom and grace
of its versification; indeed he may be said to have brought the
<i>verso sciolto</i> to the highest development it has reached in Italy.
His prose works consist of translations from Aristotle, Cyprian
and Gregory Nazianzen; and of letters, written in his own name
and in those of the cardinals Farnese, which are remarkable
both for the baseness they display and for their euphemistic
polish and elegance. His fame has been greatly damaged by the
virulence with which he attacked Lodovico Castelvetro in one
of his canzoni, and by his meanness in denouncing him to the
Holy Office as translator of some of the writings of Melanchthon.
He died at Rome about 1566.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARO, ELME MARIE<a name="ar16" id="ar16"></a></span> (1826-1887), French philosopher, was
born on the 4th of March 1826 at Poitiers. His father, a professor
of philosophy, gave him an excellent education at the
Stanislas College and the École Normale, where he graduated in
1848. After being professor of philosophy at several provincial
universities, he received the degree of doctor, and came to Paris
in 1858 as master of conferences at the École Normale. In 1861
he became inspector of the Academy of Paris, in 1864 professor
of philosophy to the Faculty of Letters, and in 1874 a member
of the French Academy. He married Pauline Cassin, the
authoress of the <i>Péché de Madeleine</i> and other well-known novels.
He died in Paris on the 13th of July 1887. In his philosophy he
was mainly concerned to defend Christianity against modern
Positivism. The philosophy of Cousin influenced him strongly,
but his strength lay in exposition and criticism rather than in
original thought. Besides important contributions to <i>La France</i>
and the <i>Revue des deux mondes</i>, he wrote <i>Le Mysticisme au
XVIII<span class="sp">e</span> siècle</i> (1852-1854), <i>L&rsquo;Idee de Dieu</i> (1864), <i>Le Matérialisme

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CAROL<a name="ar17" id="ar17"></a></span> (O. Fr. <i>carole</i>), a hymn of praise, especially such as
is sung at Christmas in the open air. The origin of the word is
obscure. Diez suggests that the word is derived from <i>chorus</i>.
Others ally it with <i>corolla</i>, a garland, circle or coronet,<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a> the
earliest sense of the word being apparently &ldquo;a ring&rdquo; or &ldquo;circle,&rdquo;
&ldquo;a ring dance.&rdquo; Stonehenge, often called the Giants&rsquo; Dance,
was also frequently known as the Carol; thus Harding, <i>Chron.</i>
lxx. x., &ldquo;Within (the) Giauntes Carole, that so they hight, The
(Stone hengles) that nowe so named been.&rdquo; The Celtic forms, often
cited as giving the origin of the word, are derivatives of the English
or French. The crib set up in the churches at Christmas was the
centre of a dance, and some of the most famous of Latin Christmas
hymns were written to dance tunes. These songs were called
<i>Wiegenlieder</i> in German, <i>noéls</i> in French, and carols in English.
They were originally modelled on the songs written to accompany
the choric dance, which were probably the starting-point of the
lyric poetry of the Germanic peoples. Strictly speaking, therefore,
the word should be applied to lyrics written to dance
measures; in common acceptation it is applied to the songs
written for the Christmas festival. Carolling, <i>i.e.</i> the combined
exercise of dance and song, found its way from pagan ritual into
the Christian church, and the clergy, however averse they might
be from heathen survivals, had to content themselves in this,
as in many other cases, with limiting the practice. The third
council of Toledo (589) forbade dancing in the churches on the
vigils of saints&rsquo; days, and secular dances in church were forbidden
by the council of Auxerre in the next year. Even as late as 1209
it was necessary for the council of Avignon to forbid theatrical
dances and secular songs in churches. Religious dances persisted
longest on Shrove Tuesday, and a castanet dance by the choristers
round the lectern is permitted three times a year in the cathedral
of Seville. The Christmas festival, which synchronized with and
superseded the Latin and Teutonic feasts of the winter solstice,
lent itself especially to gaiety. The &ldquo;crib&rdquo; of the Saviour was
set up in the churches or in private houses, in the traditional
setting of the stable, with earthen figures of the Holy Family,
the ox and the ass; and carols were sung and danced around it.
The &ldquo;rocking of the cradle&rdquo; was the occasion of dialogue
between Joseph and Mary which was not without elements of
comedy, and gave rise to lullabies such as the well-known
German <i>Dormi fili</i>. The adoration of the shepherds and the
visit of the Magi also provided matter for dramatic and choral
representation. The singing of the carol has survived in places
where the institution of the &ldquo;crib,&rdquo; said to have been originated
by St Francis of Assisi to inculcate the doctrine of the incarnation,
has been long in disuse, but in the West Riding of Yorkshire
the children who go round carol-singing still carry &ldquo;milly-boxes&rdquo;
(My Lady boxes) containing figures which represent the
Virgin and Child.</p>

<p>That carol-singing early became a pretext for the asking of
alms is obvious from an Anglo-Norman carol preserved in the
British Museum (MS. Reg. 16 E. viii.), <i>Seigneurs ore entendey
à nus</i>, which is little more than a drinking song. Carols were an
important element in the mystery plays of the Nativity, and
one of these, included in the <i>Marguerites de la Marguerite des
princesses, très-illustre reine de Navarre</i> (Lyons, 1547), incidentally
gives evidence of the connexion of dancing and carol-singing,
for the shepherds and shepherdesses open their chorus at the
manger with &ldquo;<i>Dansons, chantons, faisons rage</i>.&rdquo; There is a long
English carol relating the chief incidents of the life of Christ,
which is a curious example of the mixture of the sacred and profane
common in this species of composition. It begins &ldquo;To-morrow
shall be my dancing day,&rdquo; and has for refrain&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Sing, oh! my love, oh! my love, my love, my love;</p>
<p class="i05">This have I done for my true love.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>There are extant numerous carols dating from the 15th century
which have the characteristic features of folksong. The famous
Cherry-tree Carol, &ldquo;Joseph was an old man,&rdquo; is based on an
old legend which is related in the Coventry mystery plays.
&ldquo;I saw three ships come sailing in,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Camel and the
Crane,&rdquo; though of more modern date, preserve curious legends.
Numerous entries in the household accounts of the Tudor
sovereigns show that carol-singing was popular throughout
the 16th century, and the literature of Christmas was enriched
in the next century by poems which are often included in collections
of carols, though they were probably written to be read
rather than sung. Milton, Crashaw, Southwell, Ben Jonson,
George Herbert and George Wither all produced Christmas
poems, but the richest collection by any one poet is to be found
in the poems of Herrick, whose &ldquo;Come, bring with a noise&rdquo; is
a typical carol of the jovial kind, and may well have been written
to a dance tune. Among 18th-century religious carols perhaps
the most famous is Charles Wesley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hark, how all the welkin
rings,&rdquo; better known in the variant, &ldquo;Hark, the herald angels
sing.&rdquo; The artificial modern revival of carol-singing has produced
a quantity of new carols, the best of which are perhaps
mostly derived from medieval Latin Christmas hymns. Among
the many modern Christmas poems one of the most striking
is Swinburne&rsquo;s &ldquo;Three Damsels in the Queen&rsquo;s Chamber,&rdquo;
which is, however, a ballad rather than a carol.</p>

<p>The earliest printed collection of carols was issued by Wynkyn
de Worde in 1521. It contained the famous Boar&rsquo;s Head carol,
<i>Caput apri defero, Reddens laudes Domino</i>, which in a slightly
altered form is sung at Queen&rsquo;s College, Oxford, on the bringing
in of the boar&rsquo;s head. Modern collections of ancient carols
are derived chiefly from three tracts belonging to the collection
of Anthony à Wood, preserved in the Bodleian library, from
a 15th-century MS. (Sloane 2593), a 16th-century MS. with the
music (Add. 5665), and other MSS. in the British Museum,
and from oral tradition. In the 15th century T. Bloomer of
Birmingham published a number of carols in the form of broad-sides.
Among the numerous collections of French carols is
<i>Noei Borguignon de Gui Barôzai</i> (1720), giving the words and
the music of thirty-four <i>noëls</i>, many of them very free in character.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page380" id="page380"></a>380</span>
The term <i>noël</i> passed into the English carol as a favourite refrain,
&ldquo;nowell,&rdquo; and seems to have been in common use in France as an
equivalent for <i>vivat</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAROLINE<a name="ar18" id="ar18"></a></span> (1683-1737), wife of George II., king of Great
Britain and Ireland, was a daughter of John Frederick, margrave
of Brandenburg-Ansbach (d. 1686). Born at Ansbach on the 1st
of March 1683, the princess passed her youth mainly at Dresden
and Berlin, where she enjoyed the close friendship of Sophie
Charlotte, wife of Frederick I. of Prussia; she married George
Augustus, electoral prince of Hanover, in September 1705.
The early years of her married life were spent in Hanover. She
took a continual interest in the approaching accession of the
Hanoverian dynasty to the British throne, was on very friendly
terms with the old electress Sophia, and corresponded with
Leibnitz, whose acquaintance she had made in Berlin. In
October 1714 Caroline followed her husband and her father-in-law,
now King George I., to London. As princess of Wales she
was accessible and popular, and took the first place at court,
filling a difficult position with tact and success. When the quarrel
between the prince of Wales and his father was attaining serious
proportions, Caroline naturally took the part of her husband,
and matters reached a climax in 1717. Driven from court,
ostracized by the king, deprived even of the custody of their
children, the prince and princess took up their residence in London
at Leicester House, and in the country at Richmond. They
managed, however, to surround themselves with a distinguished
circle; Caroline had a certain taste for literature, and among
their attendants and visitors were Lord Chesterfield, Pope,
Gay, Lord Hervey and his wife, the beautiful Mary Lepel.
A formal reconciliation with George I. took place in 1720. In
October 1727 George II. and his queen were crowned. During
the rest of her life Queen Caroline&rsquo;s influence in English politics
was very chiefly exercised in support of Sir Robert Walpole;
she kept this minister in power, and in control of church patronage.
She was exceedingly tolerant, and the bishops appointed
by her were remarkable rather for learning than for orthodoxy.
During the king&rsquo;s absences from England she was regent of the
kingdom on four occasions. On the whole, Caroline&rsquo;s relations
with her husband, to whom she bore eight children, were satisfactory.
A clever and patient woman, she was very complaisant
towards the king, flattering his vanity and acknowledging his
mistresses, and she retained her influence over him to the end.
She died on the 20th of November 1737.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAROLINE AMELIA AUGUSTA<a name="ar19" id="ar19"></a></span> (1768-1821), queen of
George IV. of Great Britain, second daughter of Charles William
Ferdinand, duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, was born on the
17th of May 1768. She was brought up with great strictness,
and her education did not fit her well for her subsequent station
in life. In 1795 she was married to the then prince of Wales
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">George IV</a></span>.), who disliked her and separated from her after
the birth of a daughter in January 1796. The princess resided
at Blackheath; and as she was thought to have been badly
treated by her profligate husband, the sympathies of the people
were strongly in her favour. About 1806 reports reflecting on
her conduct were circulated so openly that it was deemed
necessary for a commission to inquire into the circumstances.
The princess was acquitted of any serious fault, but various
improprieties in her conduct were pointed out and censured.
In 1814 she left England and travelled on the continent, residing
principally in Italy. On the accession of George in 1820, orders
were given that the English ambassadors should prevent the
recognition of the princess as queen at any foreign court. Her
name also was formally omitted from the liturgy. These acts
stirred up a strong feeling in favour of the princess among the
English people generally, and she at once made arrangements for
returning to England and claiming her rights. She rejected a
proposal that she should receive an annuity of £50,000 a year
on condition of renouncing her title and remaining abroad.
Further efforts at compromise proved unavailing; Caroline
arrived in England on the 6th of June, and one month later a bill
to dissolve her marriage with the king on the ground of adultery
was brought into the House of Lords. The trial began on the
17th of August 1820, and on the 10th of November the bill, after
passing the third reading, was abandoned. The public excitement
had been intense, the boldness of the queen&rsquo;s counsel,
Brougham and Denman, unparalleled, and the ministers felt
that the smallness of their majority was virtual defeat. The
queen was allowed to assume her title, but she was refused admittance
to Westminster Hall on the coronation day, July 19, 1821.
Mortification at this event seems to have hastened her death,
which took place on the 7th of August of the same year.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CAROLINE ISLANDS,<a name="ar20" id="ar20"></a></span> a widely-scattered archipelago in the
Pacific Ocean, E. of the Philippines and N. of New Guinea,
included in Micronesia, between 5° and 10° N., and 135° and
165° E., belonging to Germany. They fall into three main
groups, the Western, Central and Eastern Carolines, the central
being the most numerous, while the western include the Pelew
group. The total land area is about 380 sq. m., and out of this,
307 sq. m. is covered by the four main islands, Ponape and
Kusaie in the eastern group, Truk or Hogolu in the central, and
Yap in the western. These islands are of considerable elevation
(the highest point of Ponape approaches 3000 ft.), but the rest
are generally low coral islets. The climate is equable and moist,
but healthy; but the islands are subject to heavy storms. The
total population is estimated at 36,000. The natives, who are
Micronesian hybrids of finer physique than their kinsmen of the
Pelew Islands, have a comparatively high mental standard, being
careful agriculturists, and peculiarly clever boatbuilders and
navigators. The Germans divide the whole archipelago into
two administrative districts, eastern and western, having the
seats of government at Ponape and Yap respectively. The
principal article of export is copra. The islands were discovered
(at least in part) by the Portuguese Diego da Rocha in 1527,
and called by him the Sequeira Islands. In 1686 Admiral
Francesco Lazeano, who made further explorations, renamed
them the Carolines in honour of Charles II. of Spain. The
islands were subsequently visited by a few travellers; but the
natives have only in modern times been reconciled to the presence
of foreigners; an early visit of missionaries (1731) resulted in
one of several murderous attacks on white men which darken
the history of the islands; and it was only in 1875 that Spain,
claiming the group, made some attempt to assert her rights.
These were contested by Germany, whose flag was hoisted on
Yap, and the matter was referred to the arbitration of Pope
Leo XIII. in 1885. He decided in favour of Spain, but gave
Germany free trading rights; and in 1899 Germany took over
the administration of the islands from Spain, paying 25,000,000
pesetas (nearly £1,000,000 sterling).</p>

<p><i>Ancient Stone Buildings.</i>&mdash;In Ponape and Kusaie, massive stone
structures, similar to those which occur in several other parts
of the Pacific Ocean, have long been known to exist. They have
been closely explored by Herr Kubary, Mr F.J. Moss, and later
Mr F.W. Christian. None of the colossal structures hitherto
described appears to have been erected by the present Melanesian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page381" id="page381"></a>381</span>
or Polynesian peoples, while their wide diffusion, extending as
far as Easter Island, within 400 m. of the New World, points
to the occupation of the Pacific lands by a prehistoric race which
had made some advance in general culture. The Funafuti
borings (1897) show almost beyond doubt that Polynesia is an
area of comparatively recent subsidence. Hence the land connexions
must have formerly been much easier and far more
continuous than at present. The dolmen-builders of the New
Stone Age are now known to have long occupied both Korea
and Japan, from which advanced Asiatic lands they may have
found little difficulty in spreading over the Polynesian world,
just as in the extreme west they were able to range over Scandinavia,
Great Britain and Ireland. To Neolithic man, still perhaps
represented by some of the more light-coloured and more
regular-featured Polynesian groups, may therefore not unreasonably
be attributed these astonishing remains, which assume so many
different forms according to the nature of the locality, but seem
generally so out of proportion with the present restricted areas
on which they stand. With the gradual subsidence of these
areas their culture would necessarily degenerate, although echoes
of sublime theogonies and philosophies are still heard in the oral
traditions and folklore of many Polynesian groups. In the islet
of Lele, close to Kusaie, at the eastern extremity of Micronesia,
the ruins present the appearance of a citadel with cyclopean
ramparts built of large basaltic blocks. There are also numerous
canals, and what look like artificial harbours constructed amid
the shallow lagoons.</p>

<p>In Ponape the remains are of a somewhat similar character,
but on a much larger scale, and with this difference, that while
those of Lele all stand on the land, those of Ponape are built in
the water. The whole island is strewn with natural basaltic
prisms, some of great size: and of this material, brought by boats
or rafts from a distance of 30 m. and put together without any
mortar, but sustained by their own weight, are built all the
massive walls and other structures on the east side of the island.
The walls of the main building near the entrance of Metalanim
harbour form a massive quadrangle 200 ft. on all sides, with
inner courts, vault and raised platform with walls 20 to 40 ft.
high and from 8 to 18 ft. thick. Some of the blocks are 25 ft.
long and 8 ft. in circumference, and many of them weigh from
3 to 4 tons. There are also numerous canals from 30 to 100 ft.
wide, while a large number of islets, mainly artificial, covering
an area of 9 sq. m., have all been built up out of the shallow
waters of the lagoon round about the entrance of the harbour,
with high sea-walls composed of the same huge basaltic prisms.
In, some places the walls of this &ldquo;Pacific Venice&rdquo; are now
submerged to some depth, as if the land had subsided since the
construction of these extensive works. Elsewhere huge breakwaters
had been constructed, the fragments of which may still
be seen stretching away for a distance of from 2 to 3 m. Most
observers, such as Admiral Sir Cyprian Bridge and Mr. Le Hunte,
agree that these structures could not possibly be the work of any
of the present Polynesian peoples, and attribute them to a now
extinct prehistoric race, the men of the New Stone Age from the
Asiatic mainland.</p>

<p><i>Stone Money.</i>&mdash;The inhabitants of Yap are noted for possessing
the most extraordinary currency, if it can be so called, in the
whole world. Besides the ordinary shell money, there is a sort
of stone coinage, consisting of huge calcite or limestone discs or
wheels from 6 in. to 12 ft. in diameter, and weighing up to nearly
5 tons. These are all quarried in the Pelew Islands, 200 m. to
the south, and are now brought to Yap in European vessels.
But some were in the island long before the arrival of the whites,
and must consequently have been brought by native vessels or
on rafts. The stones, which are rather tokens than money, do
not circulate, but are piled up round about the chief&rsquo;s
treasure-house,
and appear to be regarded as public property, although
it is hard to say what particular use they can serve. They appear
to be kept rather for show and ornament than for use.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CAROLINGIANS,<a name="ar21" id="ar21"></a></span> the name of a family (so called from Charlemagne,
its most illustrious member) which gained the throne of
France <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 751. It appeared in history in 613, its origin being
traced to Arnulf (Arnoul), bishop of Metz, and Pippin, long
called Pippin of Landen, but more correctly Pippin the Old or
Pippin I. Albeit of illustrious descent, the genealogies which
represent Arnulf as an Aquitanian noble, and his family as
connected&mdash;by more or less complicated devices&mdash;with the
saints honoured in Aquitaine, are worthless, dating from the
time of Louis the Pious in the 9th century. Arnulf was one of
the Austrasian nobles who appealed to Clotaire II., king of
Neustria, against Brunhilda, and it was in reward for his services
that he received from Clotaire the bishopric of Metz (613).
Pippin, also an Austrasian noble, had taken a prominent part in
the revolution of 613. These two men Clotaire took as his
counsellors; and when he decided in 623 to confer the kingdom of
Austrasia upon his son Dagobert, they were appointed mentors to
the Austrasian king, Pippin with the title of mayor of the palace.
Before receiving his bishopric, Arnulf had had a son Adalgiselus,
afterwards called Anchis; Pippin&rsquo;s daughter, called Begga in later
documents, was married to Arnulf&rsquo;s son, and of this union was born
Pippin II. Towards the end of the 7th century Pippin II., called
incorrectly Pippin of Heristal, secured a preponderant authority
in Austrasia, marched at the head of the Austrasians against
Neustria, and gained a decisive victory at Tertry, near St
Quentin (687). From that date he may be said to have been
sole master of the Frankish kingdom, which he governed till his
death (714). In Neustria Pippin gave the mayoralty of the palace
to his son Grimoald, and afterwards to Grimoald&rsquo;s son Theodebald;
the mayoralty in Austrasia he gave to his son Drogo, and
subsequently to Drogo&rsquo;s children, Arnulf and Hugh. Charles
Martel, however, a son of Pippin by a concubine Chalpaïda,
seized the mayoralty in both kingdoms, and he it was who
continued the Carolingian dynasty. Charles Martel governed
from 714 to 741, and in 751 his son Pippin III. took the title of
king. The Carolingian dynasty reigned in France from 751 to
987, when it was ousted by the Capetian dynasty. In Germany
descendants of Pippin reigned till the death of Louis the Child in
911; in Italy the Carolingians maintained their position until
the deposition of Charles the Fat in 887. Charles, duke of Lower
Lorraine, who was thrown into prison by Hugh Capet in 991,
left two sons, the last male descendants of the Carolingians, Otto,
who was also duke of Lower Lorraine and died without issue, and
Louis, who after the year 1000 vanishes from history.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CARP,<a name="ar24" id="ar24"></a></span> the typical fish of a large family (<i>Cyprimdae</i>) of Ostariophysi,
as they have been called by M. Sagemehl, in which the air-bladder
is connected with the ear by a chain of small bones (so-called
Weberian ossicles). The mouth is usually more or less
protractile and always toothless; the lower pharyngeal bones,
which are large and falciform, subparallel to the branchial arches,
are provided with teeth, often large and highly specialized, in
one, two or three series (pharyngeal teeth), usually working
against a horny plate attached to a vertical process of the basioccipital
bone produced under the anterior vertebrae, mastication
being performed in the gullet. These teeth, adapted to
various requirements, vary according to the genus, being conical,
hooked, spoon-shaped, molariform, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The species are extremely numerous, about 1400 being known,
nearly entirely confined to fresh water, and feeding on vegetable
substances or small animals. They are dispersed over the whole
world with the exception of South America, Madagascar, Papuasia,
and Australasia. Remains of several of the existing
genera have been found in Oligocene and later beds of Europe,
Sumatra and North America. One member of the <i>Cyprinidae</i> is
at present known to be viviparous, but no observations have as
yet been made on its habits. It is a small barbel discovered in
Natal by Max Weber, and described by him under the name
<i>Barbus viviparus</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Cyprinidae</i><a name="fa1b" id="fa1b" href="#ft1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a> are divided into four subfamilies:&mdash;<i>Catostominae</i>
(mostly from North America, with a few species from
China and eastern Siberia), in which the maxillary bones take a
share in the border of the mouth, and the pharyngeal teeth are
very numerous and form a single, comb-like series; <i>Cyprininae</i>,
the great bulk of the family, more or less conforming to the type of
the carp; <i>Cobitinae</i>, or loaches (Europe, Asia, Abyssinia),
which are dealt with in a separate article (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Loach</a></span>); and the
<i>Homalopterinae</i> (China and south-eastern Asia), mountain forms
allied to the loaches, with a quite rudimentary air-bladder.</p>

<p>The carp itself, <i>Cyprinus carpio</i>, has a very wide distribution,
having spread, through the agency of man, over nearly the
whole of Europe and a part of North America, where it lives in
lakes, ponds, canals, and slow-running rivers with plenty of
vegetation. The carp appears to be a native of temperate Asia
and perhaps also of south-eastern Europe, and to have been
introduced into other parts in the 12th and 13th century; it was
first mentioned in England in 1496. The acclimatization of the
carp in America has been a great success, especially in the
northern waters, where, the growth continuing throughout the
entire year, the fish soon attains a remarkable size. The presence
of carp in Indo-China and the Malay Archipelago is probably
also to be ascribed to human agency. In the British Isles the
carp seldom reaches a length of 2½ ft., and a weight of 20 &#8468;,
whilst examples of that size are quite frequent on the continent,
and others measuring 4½ ft. and weighing 60 &#8468; or more are on
record. The fish is characterized by its large scales (34 to 40 in
the lateral line), its long dorsal fin, the first ray of which is stiff
and serrated, and the presence of two small barbels on each side of
the mouth. But it varies much in form and scaling, and some
most aberrant varieties have been fixed by artificial selection,
the principal being the king-carp or mirror-carp, in which the
scales are enlarged and reduced in number, forming more or less
regular longitudinal series on the sides, and the leather-carp, in
which the scales have all but disappeared, the fish being covered
with a thick, leathery skin. Deformed examples are not of rare
occurrence.</p>

<p>Although partly feeding on worms and other small forms of
animal life, the carp is principally a vegetarian, and the great
development of its pharyngeal apparatus renders it particularly
adapted to a graminivorous régime. The longevity of the fish has
probably been much exaggerated, and the statements of carp of
200 years living in the ponds of Pont-Chartrain and other places
in France and elsewhere do not rest on satisfactory evidence.</p>

<p>A close ally of the carp is the Crucian carp, <i>Cyprinus carassius</i>,
chiefly distinguished by the absence of barbels. It inhabits
Europe and northern and temperate Asia, and is doubtfully
indigenous to Great Britain. It is a small fish, rarely exceeding a
length of 8 or 9 in. It has many varieties. One of these, remarkable
for its very short, thick head and deep body, is the so-called
Prussian carp, <i>C. gibelio</i>, often imported into English
ponds, whilst the best known is the goldfish (<i>q.v.</i>), <i>C. auralus</i>,
first produced in China.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARPACCIO, VITTORIO,<a name="ar25" id="ar25"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Vittore</span> (c. 1465-c. 1522),
Italian painter, was born in Venice, cf an old Venetian family.
The facts of his life are obscure, but his principal works were
executed between 1490 and 1519; and he ranks as one of the
finest precursors of the great Venetian masters. The date of
his birth is conjectural. He is first mentioned in 1472 in a will
of his uncle Fra Ilario, and Dr Ludwig infers from this that
he was born c. 1455, on the ground that no one could enter into
an inheritance under the age of fifteen; but the inference ignores
the possibility of a testator making his will in prospect of the
beneficiary attaining his legal age. Consideration of the youthful
style of his earliest dated pictures (&ldquo;St Ursula&rdquo; series, Venice,
1490) makes it improbable that at that time he had reached so
mature an age as thirty-five; and the date of his birth is more
probably to be guessed from his being about twenty-five in 1490.
What is certain is that he was a pupil (not, as sometimes thought,
the master) of Lazzaro Bastiani, who, like the Bellini and
Vivarini, was the head of a large <i>atelier</i> in Venice, and whose
own work is seen in such pictures as the &ldquo;S. Veneranda&rdquo; at
Vienna, and the &ldquo;Doge Mocenigo kneeling before the Virgin&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Madonna and Child&rdquo; (formerly attributed to Carpaccio)
in the National Gallery, London. In later years Carpaccio
appears to have been influenced by Cima da Conegliano (<i>e.g.</i>
in the &ldquo;Death of the Virgin,&rdquo; 1508, at Ferrara). Apart from
the &ldquo;St Ursula&rdquo; series, his scattered series of the &ldquo;Life of the
Virgin&rdquo; and &ldquo;Life of St Stephen,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Dead Christ&rdquo; at
Berlin, may be specially mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARPATHIAN MOUNTAINS<a name="ar26" id="ar26"></a></span><a name="fa1j" id="fa1j" href="#ft1j"><span class="sp">1</span></a> (Lat. <i>Monies Sarmatici</i>; Med.
Lat. <i>Montes Nivium</i>), the eastern wing of the great central
mountain system of Europe. With the exception of the
extreme southern and south-eastern ramifications, which belong
to Rumania, the Carpathians lie entirely within Austrian and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page383" id="page383"></a>383</span>
Hungarian territory. They begin on the Danube near Pressburg,
surround Hungary and Transylvania in a large semicircle, the
concavity of which is towards the south-west, and end on the
Danube near Orsova. The total length of the Carpathians is
over 800 m., and their width varies between 7 and 230 m.,
the greatest width of the Carpathians corresponding with its
highest altitude. Thus the system attains its greatest breadth
in the Transylvanian plateau, and in the meridian of the Tatra
group. It covers an area of 72,600 sq. m., and after the Alps
is the most extensive mountain system of Europe. The Carpathians
do not form an uninterrupted chain of mountains,
but consist of several orographically and geologically distinctive
groups; in fact they present as great a structural variety as
the Alps; but as regards magnificence of scenery they cannot
compare with the Alps. The Carpathians, which only in a few
places attain an altitude of over 8000 ft., lack the bold peaks,
the extensive snow-fields, the large glaciers, the high waterfalls
and the numerous large lakes which are found in the Alps.
They are nowhere covered by perpetual snow, and glaciers
do not exist, so that the Carpathians, even in their highest
altitude, recall the middle region of the Alps, with which, however,
they have many points in common as regards appearance,
structure and flora. The Danube separates the Carpathians from
the Alps, which they meet only in two points, namely, the Leitha
Mountains at Pressburg, and the Bakony Mountains at Vacz
(Waitzen), while the same river separates them from the Balkan
Mountains at Orsova. The valley of the March and Oder
separates the Carpathians from the Silesian and Moravian chains,
which belong to the middle wing of the great central mountain
system of Europe. The Carpathians separate Hungary and
Transylvania from Lower Austria, Moravia, Silesia, Galicia,
Bukovina and Rumania, while its ramifications fill the whole
northern part of Hungary, and form the quadrangular mass
of the Transylvanian plateau. Unlike the other wings of the
great central system of Europe, the Carpathians, which form the
watershed between the northern seas and the Black Sea, are surrounded
on all sides by plains, namely the great Hungarian plain
on the south-west, the plain of the Lower Danube (Rumania)
on the south, and the Galician plain on the north-east.</p>

<p>The Carpathian system can be divided into two groups: the
Carpathians proper, and the mountains of Transylvania. The
Carpathians proper consist of an outer wall, which forms the
frontier between Hungary and the adjacent provinces of Austria,
and of an inner wall which fills the whole of Upper Hungary, and
forms the central group. The outer wall is a complex, roughly
circular mass of about 600 m. extending from Pressburg to the
valley of the Visó, and the Golden Bistritza, and is divided
by the Poprad into two parts, the western Carpathians and the
eastern or wooded Carpathians. Orographically, therefore,
the proper Carpathians are divided into: (<i>a</i>) the western
Carpathians, (<i>b</i>) the eastern or wooded Carpathians, and (<i>c</i>)
the central groups.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(<i>a</i>) The western Carpathians, which begin at the <i>Porta Hungarica</i>
on the Danube, just opposite the Leitha Mountains, and extend to
the Poprad river, are composed of four principal groups:
the Little Carpathians (also called the Pressburg group)
<span class="sidenote">Ranges.</span>
with the highest peak Bradlo (2670 ft.); the White Carpathians or
Miava group, with the highest peak Javornik (3325 ft.), and the
Zemerka (3445 ft.); the Beskid proper or western Beskid group,
which extends from a little west of the Jablunka pass to the river
Poprad, with the highest peaks, Beskid (3115 ft.), Smrk (4395 ft.),
Lissa Hora (4350 ft.) and Ossus (5106 ft.); and the Magura or
Arva Magura group, which extends to the south of Beskid Mountains,
and contains the Babia Gora (5650 ft.), the highest peak in the whole
western Carpathians.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The eastern or wooded Carpathians extend from the river
Poprad to the sources of the river Visó and the Golden Bistritza,
whence the Transylvanian Mountains begin, and form the link
between these mountains and the central groups or High Carpathians.
They are a monotonous sandstone range, covered with extensive
forests, which up to the sources of the rivers Ung and San are also
called the eastern Beskids, and are formed of small parallel ranges.
The northern two-thirds of this range has a mean altitude of 3250 ft.,
and only in its southern portion it attains a mean altitude of 5000 ft.
The principal peaks are Rusky Put (4264 ft.), Popadjé (5690 ft.),
Bistra (5936 ft.), Pop Ivan (6214 ft.), Tomnatik (5035 ft.), Giumaleu
(6077 ft.) and Cserna Gora (6505 ft.), the culminating peak of the
whole range. To the eastern Carpathians belongs also the range of
mountains extending between the Laborcza and the Upper Theiss,
called Vihorlat, which attains in the peak of the same name an
altitude of 3495 ft. As indicated by its name, which means &ldquo;burnt,&rdquo;
it is of volcanic origin, and plays an important part in the folklore
and in the superstitious legends of the Hungarian people.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The central groups or the High Carpathians extend from the
confluence of the rivers Arva and Waag to the river Poprad, and
include the highest group of the Carpathian system. They consist
of the High Tatra group (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Tatra Mountains</a></span>), where is found the
Gerlsdorfer or Franz Josef peak (Hung. <i>Gerlachfalvi-Csúcs</i>), with an
altitude of 8737 ft., the highest peak in the whole Carpathian Mountains.
On its west are the Liptauer Magura, with the highest peak
the Biela Szkala (6900 ft.), and on its east are the Zipser Magura,
which have a mean altitude of 3000 ft. South of the central groups
lies a widely extending mountain region, which fills the whole of
northern Hungary, and is known as the Hungarian highland. It is
composed of several groups, which are intersected by the valleys of
numerous rivers, and which descend in sloping terraces towards the
Danube and the Hungarian plain. The principal groups are: the
Neutra or Galgóc Mountains (4400 ft.), between the rivers Waag
and Neutra; the Low or Nizna Tatra, which extends to the south
of the High Tatra, and has its highest peaks, the Djumbir (6700 ft.)
and the Králova Hola (6400 ft.); this group is continued towards
the east up to the confluence of the Göllnitz with the Hernad, by the
so-called Carpathian foot-hills, with the highest peak the Zelesznik
(2675 ft.). West of the Low Tatra extend the Fatra group, with the
highest peak, the Great Fatra (5825 ft.), to the south and east of
which lie the Schemnitz group, the Ostrowsky group, and several
other groups, all of which are also called the Hungarian Ore Mountains,
on account of their richness in valuable ores. South-east of
the Low Tatra extend the Zips&mdash;Gömör Ore Mountains, while the
most eastern group is the Hegyalja Mountains, between the Topla,
Tarcza and Hernad rivers, which run southward from Eperjes to
Tokaj. In their northern portion, they are also called Sóvár Mountains,
and reach in their highest peak, Simonka, an altitude of 3350 ft.,
while their southern portion, which ends with the renowned Tokaj
Hill (1650 ft.), is also called Tokaj Mountains. The smaller groups
of the Hungarian highland are: on the south-west the Neograd
Mountains (2850), whose offshoots reach the Danube; to the east
of them extends the Matra group, with the highest peak the Saskö
(3285 ft.). The Matra group is of volcanic origin, rising abruptly in
the great Hungarian plain, and constitutes one of the most beautiful
groups of the Carpathians; lastly, to its east extend the thickly-wooded
Bükk Mountains (3100 ft.).</p>

<p>Throughout the whole of the Carpathian system there are numerous
mountain lakes, but they cannot compare with the Alpine lakes
<span class="sidenote">Lakes.</span>
either in extension or beauty. The largest and most
numerous are found in the Tatra Mountains. These lakes
are called by the people &ldquo;eyes of the sea,&rdquo; through their belief that
they are in subterranean communication with the sea.</p>

<p>The western and central Carpathians are much more accessible
than the eastern Carpathians and the Transylvanian Mountains.
The principal passes in the western Carpathians are:
Strany, Hrozinkau, Wlara, Lissa and the Jablunka pass
<span class="sidenote">Passes.</span>
(1970 ft.), the principal route between Silesia and Hungary, crossed
by the Breslau-Budapest railway; and the Jordanow pass. In the
central Carpathians are: the road from Neumarkt to Késmárk
through the High Tatra, the Telgárt pass over the Králova Hola
from the Poprad to the Gran, and the Tylicz pass from Bartfeld to
Tarnow. In the eastern Carpathians are: the Dukla pass, the
Mezo-Laborcz pass crossed by the railway from Tokaj to Przemysl;
the Uszok pass, crossed by the road from Ungvár to Sambor; the
Vereczke pass, crossed by the railway from Lemberg to Munkács;
the Delatyn or Körösmezö pass (3300 ft.), also called the Magyar
route, crossed by the railway from Kolomea to Debreczen; and the
Stiol pass in Bukovina.</p>

<p>The Carpathians consist of an outer zone of newer beds and an
inner zone of older rocks. Between the two zones lies a row of
<i>Klippen</i>, while towards the Hungarian plain the inner
zone is bordered by a fringe of volcanic eruptions of
<span class="sidenote">Geology.</span>
Tertiary age. The <i>outer zone</i> is continuous throughout the whole
extent of the chain, and is remarkably uniform both in composition
and structure. It is formed almost entirely of a succession of sandstones
and shales of Cretaceous and Tertiary age&mdash;the so-called
Carpathian Sandstone&mdash;and these are thrown into a series of isoclinal
folds dipping constantly to the south. The folding of this zone
took place during the Miocene period. The <i>inner zone</i> is not continuous,
and is much more complex in structure. It is visible only
in the west and in the east, while in the central Carpathians, between
the Hernad and the headwaters of the Theiss, it is lost beneath the
modern deposits of the Hungarian plain. In the western Carpathians
the inner zone consists of a foundation of Carboniferous and older
rocks, which were folded and denuded before the deposition of the
succeeding strata. In the outer portion of the zone the Permian
and Mesozoic beds are crushed and folded against the core of ancient
rocks; in the inner portion of the zone they rest upon the old foundation
with but little subsequent disturbance. In the eastern Carpathians
also, the Permian and Mesozoic beds are not much folded
except near the outer margin of the zone. The <i>Klippen</i> are isolated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page384" id="page384"></a>384</span>
hills, chiefly of Jurassic limestone, rising up in the midst of the later
and softer deposits on the inner border of the sandstone zone.
Their relations to the surrounding beds are still obscure. They may
be &ldquo;rootless&rdquo; masses brought upon the top of the later beds by
thrustplanes. They may be the pinched-up summits of sharp
anticlinals, which in the process of folding have been forced through
the softer rocks which lay upon them. Or, finally, they may have
been islands rising above the waters, in which were deposited the
later beds which now surround them. The so-called <i>Klippen</i> of the
Swiss Alps are now usually supposed to rest upon thrustplanes, but
they are not strictly analogous, either in structure or in position,
with those of the Carpathians. Of all the peculiar features of the
Carpathian chain, perhaps the most remarkable is the fringe of
volcanic rocks which lies along its inner margin. The outbursts
began in the later part of the Eocene period, and continued into the
Pliocene, outlasting the period of folding. They appear to be
associated with faulting upon the inner margin of the chain.
Trachytes, rhyolites, andesites and basalts occur, and a definite
order of succession has been made out in several areas; but this
order is not the same throughout the chain.</p>

<p>The Carpathians, like the Alps, form a protective wall to the
regions south of them, which enjoy a much milder climate than those
situated to the north. The vegetation of these regions is
naturally subjected to the different climateric conditions.
<span class="sidenote">Climate, Flora, Fauna.</span>
The mountains themselves are mostly covered with forests,
and their vegetation presents four zones: that of the
beech extends to an altitude of 4000 ft.; that of the Scottish fir to
1000 ft. higher. Above this grows a species of pine, which becomes
dwarfed and disappears at an altitude of about 6000 ft., beyond
which is a zone of lichen and moss covered or almost bare rock.
The highest parts in the High Tatra and in the Transylvanian
Mountains have a flora similar to that of the Alps, more specially
that of the middle region. Remarkable is the sea-shore flora, which
is found in the numerous salt-impregnated lakes, ponds and marshes
in Transylvania. As regards the fauna, the Carpathians still contain
numerous bears, wolves and lynxes, as well as birds of prey. It
presents a characteristic feature in its mollusc fauna, which contains
many species not found in the neighbouring regions, and only found
in the Alpine region. Cattle and sheep are pastured in great numbers
on its slopes.</p>

<p>The Carpathian system is richer in metallic ores than any other
mountain system of Europe, and contains large quantities of gold,
silver, copper, iron, lead, coal, petroleum, salt, zinc, &amp;c.,
<span class="sidenote">Minerals.</span>
besides a great variety of useful mineral. A great number
of mineral springs and thermal waters are found in the Carpathians,
many of which have become frequented watering-places.</p>

<p>The systematic and scientific exploration of the Carpathians
dates only from the beginning of the 19th century. The first ascension
of the Lomnitzer peak in the High Tatra was made
by one David or Johann Fröhlich in 1615. The first
<span class="sidenote">History.</span>
account of the Tatra Mountains was written by Georg Buchholz, a
resident of Kesmark in 1664. The English naturalist, Robert
Townson, explored the Tatra in 1793 and 1794, and was the first to
make a few reliable measurements. The results of his exploration
appeared in his book, <i>Travels in Hungary</i>, published in 1797. But
the first real important work was undertaken by the Swedish
naturalist, Georg Wablenberg (1780-1851), who in 1813 explored the
central Carpathians as a botanist, but afterwards also made topographical
and geological studies of the system. The results of all
the former explorations were embodied by A. von Sydow in an
extensive work published in 1827. During the 19th century the
measurements of the various parts of the Carpathians was undertaken
by the ordnance survey of the Austrian army, which published
their first map of the central Carpathians in 1870. A great stimulus
to the study of this mountain system was given by the foundation
of the Hungarian Carpathian Society in 1873, and a great deal of
information has been added to our knowledge since. In 1880
two new Carpathian societies were formed: a Galician and a
Transylvanian.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARPEAUX, JEAN BAPTISTE<a name="ar28" id="ar28"></a></span> (1827-1875), French sculptor,
was born at Valenciennes, France, on the 11th of May 1827.
He was the son of a mason, and passed his early life in extreme
poverty. In 1842 he came to Paris, and after working for two
years in a drawing-school, was admitted to the École des Beaux-Arts
on the 9th of September 1854. The Grand Prix de Rome
was awarded to his statue of &ldquo;Hector bearing in his arms his
son Astyanax.&rdquo; His first work exhibited at the Salon, in 1853,
did not show the spirit of an innovator, and was very unlike the
work of his master Rude. At Rome he was fascinated by
Donatello, and yet more influenced by Michelangelo, to whom
he owes his feeling for vehement and passionate action. He
sent from Rome a bust, &ldquo;La Palombella,&rdquo; 1856; and a &ldquo;Neapolitan
Fisherman,&rdquo; 1858. This work was again exhibited in the
Salon of 1859, and took a second-class medal; but it was not
executed in marble till 1863. In his last year in Rome he sent
home a dramatic group, &ldquo;Ugolino and his Sons,&rdquo; and exhibited
at the same time a &ldquo;Bust of Princess Mathilde.&rdquo; This gained
him a second-class medal and the favour of the Imperial family.
In 1864 he executed the &ldquo;Girl with a Shell,&rdquo; the companion
figure to the young fisherman; and although in 1865 he did
not exhibit at the Salon, busts of &ldquo;Mme. A.E. André,&rdquo; of
&ldquo;Giraud&rdquo;  the painter, and of &ldquo;Mlle. Benedetti&rdquo; showed
that he was not idle. He was working at the same time on the
decorations of the Pavilion de Flore, of which the pediment
alone was seen at the Salon, though the bas-relief below is an
even better example of his style. After producing a statue of
the prince imperial, Carpeaux was made chevalier of the Legion
of Honour in 1866. Two years later he received an important
commission to execute one of the four groups for the façade
of the new opera house. His group, representing &ldquo;Dancing,&rdquo;
1869, was greeted with indignant protests; it is nevertheless
a sound work, full of movement, with no fault but that of exceeding
the limitations prescribed. In 1869 he exhibited a
&ldquo;Bust of M. Gamier,&rdquo; and followed this up with two pieces
intended for his native city: a statue of Watteau, and a bas-relief,
&ldquo;Valenciennes repelling Invasion.&rdquo; During the Commune
he came to England, and made a &ldquo;Bust of Gounod&rdquo; in 1871.
His last important work was a fountain, the &ldquo;Four Quarters of
the World,&rdquo; in which the globe is sustained by four female
figures personifying Europe, Asia, Africa and America. This
fountain is now in the Avenue de l&rsquo;Observatoire in Paris. Carpeaux,
though exhausted by illness, continued designing indefatigably,
till he died at the Château de Bécon, near Courbevoie,
on the 12th of October 1875, after being promoted to the higher
grade of the Legion of Honour. Many of his best drawings have
been presented by Prince Stirbey to the city of Valenciennes.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARPENTARIA, GULF OF,<a name="ar29" id="ar29"></a></span> an extensive arm of the sea deeply
indenting the north coast of Australia, between 10° 40&prime; and
17° 40&prime; S., and 135° 30&prime; and 142° E. Its length is 480 m. and its

islands called Wellesley; and towards the western side are the
Sir Edward Pellew Islands, the Groote Eylandt and others.
A large number of rivers find their way to the gulf, and some are
of considerable size. On the eastern side there is the Mitchell
river; at the south-east corner the Gilbert, the Norman, the
Flinders, the Leichhardt and the Gregory; and on the west the
Roper river. Jan Carstensz, who undertook a voyage of discovery
in this part of the globe in 1623, gave the name of Carpentier
to a small river near Cape Duyfhen in honour of Pieter
Carpentier, at that time governor-general of the Dutch East
Indies; and after the second voyage of Abel Tasman in 1644,
the gulf, which he had successfully explored, began to appear on

son of a carpet manufacturer. After some months at a non-conformist
academy at Northampton, he proceeded to Glasgow
University, and then joined the ministry. After a short time
as assistant master at a Unitarian school near Birmingham, he

In 1805 he became pastor of a church in Exeter, removing in
1817 to Bristol. At both Bristol and Exeter he was also engaged
in school work, among his Bristol pupils being Harriet and
James Martineau. Carpenter did much to broaden the spirit
of English Unitarianism. The rite of baptism seemed to him a
superstition, and he substituted for it a form of infant dedication.
His health, undermined by his constant labours, broke down in
1839, and he was ordered to travel. He was drowned on the
night of the 5th of April 1840, having been washed overboard
from the steamer in which he was travelling from Leghorn to

social reformer, was born on the 3rd of April 1807 at Exeter,
where her father, Dr Lant Carpenter, was Unitarian minister.
In 1817 the family removed to Bristol, where Dr Carpenter was
called to the ministry of Lewin&rsquo;s Mead Meeting. As a child
Mary Carpenter was unusually earnest, with a deep religious vein
and a remarkable thoroughness in everything she undertook.
She was educated in her father&rsquo;s school for boys, learning Latin,
Greek and mathematics, and other subjects at that time not
generally taught to girls. She early showed an aptitude for
teaching, taking a class in the Sunday school, and afterwards
helping her father with his pupils. When Dr Carpenter gave
up his school in 1829, his daughters opened a school for girls
under Mrs Carpenter&rsquo;s superintendence. In 1833 the raja
Rammohun Roy visited Bristol, and inspired Miss Carpenter
with a warm interest in India; and Dr Joseph Tuckerman of
Boston about the same time aroused her sympathies for the condition
of destitute children. Her life-work began with her taking
part in organizing, in 1835, a &ldquo;Working and Visiting Society,&rdquo;
of which she was secretary for twenty years. In 1843 her interest
in negro emancipation was aroused by a visit from Dr S.G.
Howe. Her interest in general educational work was also
growing. A bill introduced in this year &ldquo;to make provision
for the better education of children in manufacturing districts,&rdquo;
as a first instalment of a scheme of national education, failed to
pass, largely owing to Nonconformist opposition, and private
effort became doubly necessary. So-called &ldquo;Ragged Schools&rdquo;
sprang up in many places, and Miss Carpenter conceived the plan
of starting one in Lewin&rsquo;s Mead. To this was added a night-school
for adults. In spite of many difficulties this was rendered
a success, chiefly owing to Miss Carpenter&rsquo;s unwearied enthusiasm
and remarkable organizing power. In 1848 the closing of their
own private school gave Miss Carpenter more leisure for
philanthropic and literary work. She published a memoir of Dr
Tuckerman, and a series of articles on ragged schools, which
appeared in the <i>Inquirer</i> and were afterwards collected in book
form. This was followed in 1851 by <i>Reformatory Schools for
the Children of the Perishing and Dangerous Classes, and for
Juvenile Offenders</i>. She sketched out three classes of schools as
urgently needed:&mdash;(1) good free day-schools; (2) feeding
industrial schools; (3) reformatory schools. This book drew
public attention to her work, and from that time onwards she
was drawn into personal intercourse with leading thinkers and
workers. She was consulted in the drafting of educational bills,
and invited to give evidence before House of Commons committees.
To test the practical value of her theories, she herself
started a reformatory school at Bristol, and in 1852 she published
<i>Juvenile Delinquents, their Condition and Treatment</i>, which
largely helped on the passing of the Juvenile Offenders Act in
1854. Now that the principle of reformatory schools was
established, Miss Carpenter returned to her plea for free
day-schools, contending that the ragged schools were entitled to
pecuniary aid from the annual parliamentary grant. At the
Oxford meeting of the British Association (1860) she read a
paper on this subject, and, mainly owing to her instigation,
a conference on ragged schools in relation to government grants
for education was held at Birmingham (1861). In 1866 Miss
Carpenter was at last able to carry out a long-cherished plan of
visiting India, where she found herself an honoured guest. She
visited Calcutta, Madras and Bombay, inaugurated the Bengal
Social Science Association, and drew up a memorial to the
governor-general dealing with female education, reformatory
schools and the state of gaols. This visit was followed by others
in 1868 and 1869. Her attempt to found a female normal school
was unsuccessful at the time, owing to the inadequate previous
education of the women, but afterwards such colleges were
founded by government. A start, however, was made with a
model Hindu girls&rsquo; school, and here she had the co-operation of
native gentlemen. Her last visit to India took place in 1875,
two years before her death, when she had the satisfaction of
seeing many of her schemes successfully established. At the
meeting of the prison congress in 1872 she read a paper on
&ldquo;Women&rsquo;s Work in the Reformation of Women Convicts.&rdquo;
Her work now began to attract attention abroad. Princess
Alice of Hesse summoned her to Darmstadt to organize a Women&rsquo;s
Congress. Thence she went to Neuchâtel to study the prison
system of Dr Guillaume, and in 1873 to America, where she was
enthusiastically received. Miss Carpenter watched with interest
the increased activity of women during the busy &rsquo;seventies.
She warmly supported the movement for their higher education,
and herself signed the memorial to the university of London in
favour of admitting them to medical degrees. She died at
Bristol on the 14th of June 1877, having lived to see the
accomplishment of nearly all the reforms for which she had worked
and hoped.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARPENTER, WILLIAM BENJAMIN<a name="ar32" id="ar32"></a></span> (1813-1885), English
physiologist and naturalist, was born at Exeter on the 29th
of October 1813. He was the eldest son of Dr Lant Carpenter.
He attended medical classes at University College, London,
and then went to Edinburgh, where he took the degree of M.D.
in 1839. The subject of his graduation thesis, &ldquo;The Physiological
Inferences to be Deduced from the Structure of the Nervous
System of Invertebrated Animals,&rdquo; indicates a line of research
which had fruition in his <i>Principles of General and Comparative
Physiology</i>. His work in comparative neurology was recognized
in 1844 by his election to the Royal Society, which awarded
him a Royal medal in 1861; and his appointment as Fullerian
professor of physiology in the Royal Institution in 1845 enabled
him to exhibit his powers as a teacher and lecturer, his gift of
ready speech and luminous interpretation placing him in the
front rank of exponents, at a time when the popularization of
science was in its infancy. His manifold labours as investigator,
author, editor, demonstrator and lecturer knew no cessation
through life; but in assessing the value of his work, prominence
should be given to his researches in marine zoology, notably
in the lower organisms, as Foraminifera and Crinoids. These
researches gave an impetus to deep-sea exploration, an outcome
of which was in 1868 the &ldquo;Lightning,&rdquo; and later the more
famous &ldquo;Challenger,&rdquo; expedition. He took a keen and laborious
interest in the evidence adduced by Canadian geologists as to the
organic nature of the so-called <i>Eozoon Canadense</i>, discovered
in the Laurentian strata, and at the time of his death had
nearly finished a monograph on the subject, defending the now
discredited theory of its animal origin. He was an adept in the
use of the microscope, and his popular treatise on <i>The Microscope
and its Revelations</i> (1856) has stimulated a host of observers to the
use of the &ldquo;added sense&rdquo; with which it has endowed man.
In 1856 Carpenter became registrar of the university of London,
and held the office for twenty-three years; on his resignation in
1879 he was made a C.B. in recognition of his services to education
generally. Biologist as he was, Carpenter nevertheless
made reservations as to the extension of the doctrine of evolution
to man&rsquo;s intellectual and spiritual nature. In his <i>Principles of
Mental Physiology</i> he asserted both the freedom of the will and
the existence of the &ldquo;Ego,&rdquo; and one of his last public engagements
was the reading of a paper in support of miracles. He
died in London, from injuries occasioned by the accidental
upsetting of a spirit-lamp, on the 19th of November 1885.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARPENTRAS,<a name="ar33" id="ar33"></a></span> a town of south-eastern France, capital of
an arrondissement in the department of Vaucluse 16 m. N.E.
of Avignon by rail. Pop. (1906) town, 7775; commune, 10,721.
The town stands on the left bank of the Auzon on an eminence,
the summit of which is occupied by the church of St Siffrein, formerly
a cathedral, and the adjoining law-court. St Siffrein, in
its existing state, dates from the 15th and 16th centuries and is
Gothic in style, but it preserves remains of a previous church
of Romanesque architecture. The rich sculpture of the southern
portal and the relics and works of art in the interior are of some
interest. The law-court, built in 1640 as the bishop&rsquo;s palace,
contains in its courtyard a small but well-preserved triumphal
arch of the Gallo-Roman period. Other important buildings
are the hospital, an imposing structure of the 18th century,
opposite which is a statue of its founder, Malachie d&rsquo;Inguimbert,
bishop of Carpentras; and the former palace of the papal
legate, which dates from 1640. Of the old fortifications the only
survival is the Porte d&rsquo;Orange, a gateway surmounted by a fine
machicolated tower. Their site is now occupied by wide boulevards
shaded by plane-trees. Water is brought to the town by
an aqueduct of forty-eight arches, completed in 1734.</p>

<p>Carpentras is the seat of a sub-prefect and of a court of assizes,
and has a tribunal of first instance, communal college for girls
and boys, a large library and a museum. Felt hats, confectionery,
preserved fruits and nails are its industrial products, and
there are silk-works, tanneries and dye-works. There is trade
in silk, wool, fruit, oil, &amp;c. The irrigation-canal named after the
town flows to the east of it (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Vaucluse</a></span>).</p>

<p>Carpentras is identified with <i>Carpentoracte</i>, a town of Gallia
Narbonensis mentioned by Pliny, which appears to have been
of some importance during the Roman period. Its medieval
history is full of vicissitudes; it was captured and plundered
by Vandal, Lombard and Saracen. In later times, as capital
of the Comtat Venaissin, it was frequently the residence of the
popes of Avignon, to whom that province belonged from 1228
till the Revolution. Carpentras was the seat of a bishopric from
the 5th century till 1805.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CARPENTRY,<a name="ar34" id="ar34"></a></span> the art and work of a carpenter (from Lat.
<i>carpentum</i>, a carriage), a workman in wood, especially for building
purposes. The labour of the sawyer is applied to the division
of large pieces of timber or logs into forms and sizes to suit the
purposes of the carpenter and joiner. His working-place is
called a sawpit, and his most important tool is a pit-saw. A
cross-cut saw, axes, dogs, files, compasses, lines, lampblack,
blacklead, chalk and a rule may also be regarded as necessary
to him. But this method of sawing timber is now only used in
remote country places, and in modern practice logs, &amp;c., are
converted into planks and small pieces at saw-mills, which are
equipped with modern machinery to drive all kinds of circular
saws by electricity, steam or gas.</p>

<p>Carpentry or carpenters&rsquo; work has been divided into three
principal branches&mdash;descriptive, constructive and mechanical.
The first shows the lines or method for forming every species of
work by the rules of geometry; the second comprises the practice
of reducing the timber into particular forms, and joining the
forms so produced in such a way as to make a complete whole
according to the intention or design; and the third displays
the relative strength of the timbers and the strains to which
they are subjected by their disposition. Here we have merely
to describe the practical details of the carpenter&rsquo;s work in the
operations of building. He is distinguished from the joiner by
his operations being directed to the mere carcass of a building,
to things which have reference to structure only. Almost everything
the carpenter does to a building is absolutely necessary
to its stability and efficiency, whereas the joiner does not begin
his operations until the carcass is complete, and every article
of joiners&rsquo; work might at any time be removed from a building
without undermining it or affecting its most important qualities.
Certainly in the practice of building a few things do occur regarding
which it is difficult to determine to whose immediate province
they belong, but the distinction is sufficiently broad for general
purposes.</p>

<p>The carpenter frames or combines separate pieces of timber
by scarfing, notching, cogging, tenoning, pinning and wedging,
&amp;c. The tools he uses are the rule, axe, adze, saws, mallet,
hammers, chisels, gouges, augers, pincers, set squares, bevel,
compasses, gauges, level, plumb rule, jack, trying and smoothing
planes, rebate and moulding planes, and gimlets and wedges.
The carpenter has little labour to put on to the stuff; his chief
work consists in fixing and cutting the ends of timbers, the
labour in preparing the timber being done by machinery.</p>

<p><i>Joints.</i>&mdash;The joints in carpentry are various, and each is
designed according to the thrust or strain put upon it. Those
principally used are the following: lap, fished, scarf, notching,
cogging, dovetailing, housing, halving, mortice and tenon, stub
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page387" id="page387"></a>387</span>
tenon, dovetailed tenon, tusk tenon, joggle, bridle, foxtail
wedging, mitre, birdsmouth, built-up, dowel. Illustrations are
given of the most useful joints in general use, and these,
together with the descriptions, will enable a good idea to be
formed of their respective merits and methods of application.</p>

<p>The lapped joint (fig. 1) is used for temporary structures in
lengthening timbers and is secured with iron straps and bolts;
a very common use of the lap joint is seen in scaffolding
secured with cords and wedges.</p>

<p>The fished joint (fig. 2) is used for lengthening beams and
is constructed by butting the ends of two pieces of timber
together with an iron plate on top and bottom, and bolting
through the timber; these iron connecting-plates are usually
about 3 ft. long and ¼ in.  and ½ in. in thickness.
This joint provides a good and cheap method of
accomplishing its purpose.</p>

<p>The scarf joint  (figs. 3, 4 and 5) is used for lengthening
beams, and is made by cutting and notching
the ends of timbers and lapping and fitting and
bolting through. This method cuts into the timber,
but is very strong and neat; in addition for
extra strong work an iron fish-plate is
used as in the fished joint.</p>

<p>The ends of floor joints and rafters
are usually  <i>notched</i> (fig. 6) over plates
to obtain a good bearing and bring
them to the required levels. Where
one timber crosses another as in purlins,
rafters, wood floor girders, plates,
&amp;c, both timbers are notched so as to fit
over each other; this <i>cogging</i>
(fig. 7) serves instead of fastenings. The timbers
are held together with a spike. In this way they
are not weakened, and the joint is a very good one for
keeping them in position.</p>

<p>Dovetailing (fig. 8) is used for connecting angles of timber
together, such as lantern curbs or linings, and is the strongest
form. When an end of timber is let  entirely into
another timber it is said to be <i>housed</i> (fig. 9). Where timbers
cross one another and require to be flush on one or both faces,
sinkings are cut in each so as to fit over each other (<i>halving</i>);
these can either be square (fig. 10), bevelled (fig. 11) or dovetailed
sinkings (fig. 12). The end of one piece of timber cut so
as to leave a third of the thickness forms a <i>tenon</i>, and the piece
of timber which is to be joined to it has a mortice or slot cut
through it to receive the tenon; the two are then
wedged or pinned with wood pins (fig. 13).</p>

<p>A stub tenon or joggle (fig. 14) is used for fixing
a post to a sill; a sinking is cut in the sill and a
tenon is cut on the foot of the post to fit into the
sinking to keep the post from sliding.</p>

<p>The purpose of a dovetailed tenon (fig. 15) is to
hold two pieces of wood together with mortice and
tenon so that it can be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page388" id="page388"></a>388</span>
taken apart when necessary. The tenon is cut dovetail shape,
and a long mortice permits the wide part of the tenon to
go through, and it is secured with wood wedges. Where the
floor joists or rafters are trimmed round fires, wells, &amp;c., the
tusk tenon joint (fig. 16) is used for securing the trimmer joist.
It is formed by cutting a tenon on the trimmer joist and passing
it through the side of the trimming joist and fixing it with a wood
key. Where large timbers are tusk tenoned together, the tenons
do not pass right through, but are cut in about 4 in. and spiked.</p>

<p>A bridle joint or birdsmouth (fig. 17) is formed by cutting one
end of timber either V shape or segmental, and morticing the
centre of this shaped end. Similar sinkings are cut on the
adjoining timber to fit one into the other; these are secured with
pins and also various other forms of fastenings. Foxtail wedging
(fig. 18) is a method very similar to mortice and tenon. But the
tenon does not go through the full thickness of the timber; and
also on the end of the tenon are inserted two wedges, so that
when the tenon is driven home the wedges split it and wedge
tightly into the mortice. This joint is used mostly in joinery.
The mitre is a universal joint, used for connecting angles of
timber as in the case of picture frames. Built-up joints involve
a system of lapping and bolting and fishing, as in the case of
temporary structures, for large spans of centering for arches, and
for derrick cranes. Dowels are usually 3 or 4 in. long and driven
into a circular hole in the foot of a door frame or post; the other
end is let into a hole in the sill (fig. 19).</p>

<p><i>Centering.</i>&mdash;Centering is temporary timber or framing
erected so as to carry concrete floors or arches of brick
or stone, &amp;c.; when the work has set the centering is removed
gradually. The centering for concrete floors is usually composed
of scaffold boards resting on wood bearers (fig 20). One wood
bearer rests along on top of the steel joists; through this
bearer long bolts are suspended, and to the bottom of these
bolts a second bearer is fixed, and on the bottom bearer the
scaffold boards rest. Another method, not much used now, is
to fit the boards to the size of the floor and prop them up on
legs, but among other disadvantages this process takes up
much space and is more costly.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 21.</td></tr></table>

<p>Turning piece is a name given to centering required for turning
an arch over (fig. 21); it is only 4½ in. wide on the soffit or bed,
and is generally cut out of a piece of 3 or 4 in. stuff, the top
edge being made circular to the shape of the arch. It is kept
in position whilst the arch is setting with struts from ground or
sills and is nailed to the reveals, a couple of cross traces being
wedged between. In the case of a semicircular or elliptical arch
with 4½ in. soffit this turning piece would be constructed of
ribs cut out of 4 in. stuff with ties and braces. Or the ribs could
be cut out of 1 in. stuff, in which case there must be one set of
ribs outside and one inside secured with ties and braces; each
set of ribs when formed of thin stuff is made of two thicknesses
nailed together so as to lap the joints. For spans up to 15 ft.
the thin ribs would be used, and for spans above 15 ft. ribs out
of 4 in. stuff and upwards. For arches with 9 in. soffit and
upwards, whether segmental or semicircular or elliptical, the
centres are formed with the thin ribs and laggings up to 15 ft.
span; above 15 ft. with 4 in. ribs and upwards (fig. 22). The
lower member of centres is called the tie, and is fixed so as to
tie the extremities together and to keep the centre from
spreading. Where the span is great, these ties, instead of being
fixed straight, are given a rise so as to allow for access or traffic
underneath. Braces are necessary to support the ribs from
buckling in, and must be strong enough and so arranged as to
withstand all stresses. Laggings are small pieces or strips of
wood nailed on the ribs to form the surface on which to build
the arch, and are spaced 1 in. apart for ordinary arches; for
gauged arches they are nailed close together and the joints planed
off. When centres are required to be taken down, the wedges
upon which the centre rests are first removed so as to allow the
arch to take its bearing gradually. Centres for brick sewers and
vault arching are formed in the same way as previously mentioned,
with ribs and laggings, but the thickness of the timbers
depends upon the weight to be carried.</p>

<p><i>Floors.</i>&mdash;For ordinary residential purposes floors are chiefly
constructed of timber. Up to about the year 1895 nearly
every modern building was constructed with wood joists, but
because of evidence adduced by fire brigade experts and the
serious fires that have occurred fire-resisting floors have been
introduced. These consist of steel girders and joists, filled in
with concrete or various patented brick materials in accordance
with such by-laws as those passed by the London County Council
and other authorities. The majority of the floors of public
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page389" id="page389"></a>389</span>
buildings, factories, schools, and large residential flats are now
constructed of fire-resisting materials. There are two descriptions
of flooring, single and double.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 24.&mdash;Floor pugged to resist passage of sound.</td></tr></table>

<p>Single flooring (fig. 23) consists of one row of wood joists
resting on a wall or partition at each end without any intermediate
support, and receiving the floor boards on the
upper surface and the ceiling on the underside.  Joists
<span class="sidenote">Single flooring.</span>
should never be less than 2 in. thick, or they are liable
to split when the floor brads are driven in; the thickness varies
from 2 to 4 in. and the depth from 5 to 11 in. (see <i>By-laws</i>, below),
the distance between each joist is usually 12 in. in the clear, but
greater strength is obtained in a floor by having deep joists and
placing them closer together. These floors are made firm and
prevented from buckling by the use of strutting as mentioned
hereafter.</p>

<p>The efficiency of single flooring is materially affected by the
necessity which constantly occurs in practice of trimming round
fireplaces and flues, and round well holes such as lifts, staircases,
&amp;c. Trimming is a method of supporting the end of a joist by
tenoning it into timber crossing it; the timber so tenoned is
called the trimmer joist, and the timber morticed for the tenon of
the trimmer is called the trimming joist, while the intermediate
timbers tenoned into the trimmer are known as the trimmed
joists.    This system has to be resorted to when it is impossible to
get a bearing on the wall.</p>

<p>A trimmer requires for the most part to be carried or supported
at one or both ends by the trimming joists, and both the trimmer
and the trimming joists are necessarily made stouter than if they
had to bear no more than their own share of the stress. In the
usual practice the trimmer and trimming joists are 1 in. thicker
than the common joists, but there are special regulations and
by-laws set out in the various districts and boroughs (see <i>By-laws</i>,
below) to which attention must be given.</p>

<p>The principal objection to single flooring is that the sound
passes through from floor to floor, so that, in some cases, conversation
in one room can almost be understood in another. To stop
the sound from passing through floors the remedy is to pug them
(fig. 24). This consists in using rough boarding resting on fillets
nailed to the sides of the joists about half-way up the depth of
the joists, and then filling in on top of the boarding with slag
wool usually 3 in. thick. Also to further prevent sound from
passing through floors the flooring should be tongued and the
ceiling should have a good thick floating coat, in poor work the
stuff on ceilings is very stinted. In days gone by, ceiling joists
were put at right angles to the floor joists, but this took up head
room and was costly, and the arrangement is obsolete.</p>

<p>Double flooring (fig. 25) consists of single fir joists trimmed
into steel girders; in earlier times a double floor consisted of
fir joists called binding, bridging and ceiling  joists,
but these are very little used now and the single fir
<span class="sidenote">Double flooring.</span>
joists and steel girders have taken their place.
Steel girders span from wall to wall, and on their flanges
are bolted wood plates to receive the ends of the single joists
which are notched over plates and run at right angles to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page390" id="page390"></a>390</span>
girders (fig. 26). The bearings of the joists on the wall also
rest on wall plates, so as to get a level bed, and are sometimes
notched over them. Wall plates, which are usually
4½ in. × 3 in. and are bedded on walls in
motar, take the ends of joists and distribute
the weight along the wall. The plates
bolted on the side of girders are of sizes to
suit the width of the flanges.</p>

<p>The medieval floor (fig. 27) consisted of
the framed floor with wood girders, binding,
bridging and ceiling joists; and the underside
of all the timbers was usually wrought,
the girders and binders being boldly moulded
and the other timbers either square or stop
chamfered.</p>

<p>Flooring is strengthened by the use of
strutting, either herring-bone (fig. 28) or solid
(fig. 29). Herring-bone strutting consists of
two pieces of timber, usually 2 in. × 2 in.,
fixed diagonally between each joist in continuous rows, the
rows being about 6 ft. apart. Solid strutting consists of 1¼ in.
boards, nearly the same depth as the joists and fitted tightly
between the joists, and nailed in continuous rows 6 ft. apart.
Where heavy weights are likely to be put on floors long bolts
are passed through the centre of joists at the side of strutting;
since this draws the strutting tightly together and does not
produce any forcing stress on the walls, it is undoubtedly
the best method.</p>

<p>Floors are usually constructed to carry the following loads
(including weight of floor):&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Residences, 1¼ cwt. per foot super of floor space.</p>

<p>Public buildings, 1½ cwt. per foot super of floor space.</p>

<p>Factories, 2½ to 4 cwt. per foot super of floor space.</p>

<p><i>Local By-laws.</i>&mdash;With regard to floor joists in domestic buildings,
the following are required in the Hornsey district, in the north of
London. The size of every common bearing floor joist up to 3 ft.
long in clear shall be 3 in. × 2½ in.; from 3 ft. to 6 ft. in clear it shall
be 4½ in. × 3 in.; from 6 ft. to 8 ft., 6½ in. × 2½ in.; from 8 ft. to
12 ft., 7 in. × 2½ in., and so on according to the clear span. The
Hornsey by-laws with regard to trimmers are as follows:&mdash;A
trimmer joist shall not receive more than six common joists, and
the thickness of a trimming joist receiving a trimmer at not more
than 3 ft. from one end and of every trimmer
joist shall be <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span>th of an inch greater than the
thickness for a common joist of the same
bearing for every common joist carried by a
trimmer. For example, if the common joists
are 7 in. × 2½ in. and the trimmer has six joists
trimmed into same, the size of trimmer would
have to be 7 in. × 3¼ in. The Hornsey council
also requires that the floor boards shall not be
less than <span class="spp">7</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span>ths of an inch thick.</p>

<p>There is little difference in the requirements
of the various localities. For example, the regulations
of the Croydon council require that every
common bearing joist for lengths up to 3 ft.
4 in. in clear shall be 3 in. × 2½ in.; for lengths
between 3 ft. 4 in. and 5 ft. 4 in., 4 in. × 2 in.;
for lengths between 5 ft. 4 in. and 7 ft. 4 in.,
4 in. × 3 in.; and so on according to the clear
span. The Croydon by-laws with regard to
trimmers are as follows:&mdash;A trimmer joist shall
not receive more than six common joists, and the thickness of a
trimming joist shall be 1½ in. thicker than that for common joists
of the same bearing, and the thickness of a trimmer joist shall be
¼ in. thicker for every joist trimmed into same than the common
joist. For example, if the common joists are 4 in. × 3 in. the trimming
joists would have to be 4 in. × 4¼ in., and the trimmer joist
would have to be 4 in. × 4½ in.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Partitions.</i>&mdash;Partitions are screens used to divide large floor
spaces into smaller rooms and are sometimes constructed to carry
the floors above by a system of trussing. They are built of
various materials; those in use now are common stud partitions,
bricknogged partitions, and solid deal and hardwood partitions,
4½ in. brick walls or bricks laid on their sides, so making a 3 in.
partition, and various patent partitions such as coke breeze
concrete or hollow brick partitions (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Brickwork</a></span>), iron
and wire partitions, and plaster slab partitions (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Plasterwork</a></span>).</p>

<p>There are two kinds of stud or quarter partitions, common
and trussed.</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 30.&mdash;Common Partition.</td></tr></table>

<p>Common partitions (fig. 30) simply act as a screen to divide
one room from another, and do not carry any weight. They
weigh about 25 &#8468; per foot superficial including
plastering on both sides, and are composed of 4 in. × 3 in.
<span class="sidenote">Common partitions.</span>
head and sill and 4 in. × 2 in. upright studs;
4 in. × 2 in. nogging pieces are fitted between the studs to
keep them from bending in, and are placed parallel with the
head, usually 4 ft. apart. Where door-openings occur in these
partitions the studs next the opening are 4 in. × 3 in. Should
the floor boards have been laid, the sill of the partition would
be laid direct on them, but if the partitions are erected at the
time of building the structure the sill should either rest directly
over a joist, if parallel with it, or at right angles to the joists;
should the position of the sill come between two joists, that is,
parallel with them, then short pieces called bridging pieces of
4 in. × 2 in. stuff are wedged between the two joists and nailed
to carry the sill.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 31.&mdash;Trussed Partition.</td></tr></table>

<p>Trussed partitions (fig. 31) are very similar to the last, but
they are so built as to carry their own weight and also
to support floors, and in addition have braces; the
<span class="sidenote">Trussed partitions.</span>
head and sill are larger, and calculated according to
the clear bearing and the weight put upon them. There are
two forms of trussing, namely, queen post (fig. 32) and king
post (fig. 33).</p>

<p>Bricknogged partitions are formed in the same manner as
the common stud partition, except that the studs are placed
usually 18 or 27 in. apart in the clear instead of 12 in., and
the 18 and 27 in. widths being multiples of a brick dimension,
<span class="sidenote">Bricknogged partitions.</span>
they are filled in with brickwork 4½ in. thick and
always built in cement. These are used to prevent
sound from passing from one room to another, and
also to prevent fire from spreading, and are vermin-proof.
Another method is to fill the space between the studs with coke
breeze concrete instead of brickwork.</p>

<p>Timber partitions have the advantages that they are light
and cheap and substantial, and the disadvantages that they
are not fire-resisting or sound-resisting or vermin-proof;
they should never be erected in damp positions such as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page391" id="page391"></a>391</span>
lower floors of buildings.</p>

<p>Solid wood partitions are used in offices and classrooms
of schools, the upper portions usually being
glazed; where these partitions enclose a staircase
in a public building the London Building Act requires them
to be of 2 in. hardwood, with only small panels of fire-resisting
glass.</p>

<p><i>Timber Work.</i>&mdash;Half timber work consists of a framework
of timber; the upper storeys of suburban and country residences
are often thus treated, and the spaces between the timbers are
filled in with brickwork and plastered inside, and rough cast
outside, though sometimes tiles are hung on the outside. In some
instances in country places there is no filling between the timbers,
and both sides are lath and plastered, and in others the timbers
are solid, or facing pieces are simply plugged to the walls, the
joints being pinned with hardwood pins. Half timber work
(fig. 34) well designed has a very pleasing, homely and rural
effect. The best and most durable wood to use is English oak
worked smooth on the external face and usually painted; the
by-laws of various authorities differ considerably as to the method
of construction and in the restrictions as to its use. Some very
fine early examples are to be seen in England, as at Holborn
Bars, London, in the old parts of Bristol, and at Moreton Old
Hall, near Congleton, Cheshire (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">House</a></span>, Plate IV. fig. 13).</p>

<p>Timber-framed permanent buildings are not used in the towns
of England, not being allowed by the by-laws. In some English
villages timber bungalows are allowed, plastered inside, and
either rough cast outside, or with tiles, or with sheet iron painted.
At the garden city of Letchworth, in Hertfordshire, there are
a few timber-framed bungalows (erected about 1904 and
originally intended to be used as week-end cottages), the
outsides of which are covered with sheet iron and painted.
Other instances of the temporary use of this kind of building
are found in soldiers&rsquo; barracks, offices and chapels.</p>

<p>In America and the British colonies this class of building
is very largely erected on the outskirts of the cities. In
American practice in framing the walls of wooden buildings
two distinct methods are used and are distinguished as
&ldquo;braced&rdquo; and &ldquo;balloon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Braced (fig. 35) was the only kind in use previous to
about the year 1850. In this method of framing the sills,
posts, girts and plates are made of heavy timber morticed and
pinned together and braced with 4 in. × 4 in. or 4 in. × 6 in.
braces and common studding. To frame a building in this way
it is necessary to cut all the pieces and make all the mortice
holes on the ground, and then fit them together and raise a
whole side at a time or at least one storey of it. The common
studs are only one storey high.</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:553px; height:680px" src="images/img392a.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 35.&mdash;Braced Frame.</td></tr></table>

<p>The Balloon frame (fig. 36) is composed of much smaller
scantlings and is more rapidly erected and less expensive.
The method is to first lay the sill, generally 4 in. × 6 in.,
halved at the angles. After the floor is laid, the corner posts,
usually 4 in. × 6 in., are erected and temporarily secured in
place with the aid of stays. The common studs are then set
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page392" id="page392"></a>392</span>
up and spiked to the sill, and a temporary board nailed
across their face on the inside. These common studs are
the full height from sill to roof plate, and the second tier of
floor joists are supported by notching a 1¼ in. × 7 in. board,
called a false girt or ribbon, into their inside edge at the
height to receive the floor joists. The ends of the joists are
also placed against a stud and spiked. The tops of the studs
are cut to a line, and a 2 in. × 4 in. plate is spiked on top,
an additional 2 in. × 4 in. plate being placed on the top of
the last breaking joint. Should the studs not be long
enough to reach the plate, then short pieces are fished on
with pieces of wood spiked on both sides. The diagram
shows a portion of the framework of a two-storey house
constructed in the manner described. In the balloon frame
the timbers are held together entirely by nails and spikes,
thus permitting them to be put up rapidly. The studs are
doubled where windows or openings occur. In both these
methods dwarf brick foundations should be built, upon which
to rest the sill. For buildings of a superior kind a combination
of the braced and balloon frames is sometimes adopted.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 36.&mdash;Balloon Frame.</td></tr></table>

<p>The sides of frame buildings are covered with siding, which is
fastened to a sheathing of rough boards nailed to the studs. The
siding may consist of matched boards placed diagonally, or of
clapboards or weather boards&mdash;which are thin boards thicker at
one edge than the other, and arranged horizontally with the
thick edge downwards and overlapping the thin edge of the
board below. Shingles or wooden tiles are also employed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARPET,<a name="ar35" id="ar35"></a></span> the name given to any kind of textile covering for
the ground or the floor, the like of which has also been in use on
couches and seats and sometimes even for wall or tent hangings
or curtains. In modern times, however, carpet usually means
a patterned fabric woven with a raised surface of tufts (either
cut or looped), and used as a floor covering. Other floor
coverings are and have been made also without such a tufted
surface, and of these some are simple shuttle-woven materials
plain or enriched with needlework or printed with patterns,
others are woven after the manner of tapestry-weaving (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Tapestry</a></span>) or in imitation of it, and a further class of carpets is
made of felt (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Felt</a></span>). This last material is entirely different
from that of shuttle or tapestry weaving. Although carpet
weaving by hand is, and for centuries has been, an Oriental
industry, it has also been, and is still, pursued in many European
countries. Carpet-weaving by steam-driven machinery is solely
European in origin, and was not brought to the condition of
meeting a widespread demand until the 19th century.</p>

<p>In connexion with the word &ldquo;carpet&rdquo; (Lat. <i>carpita</i>, rug;
O. Fr. <i>carpite</i>) notice may be taken of the Gr. <span class="grk" title="Tapaes">&#964;&#940;&#960;&#951;&#962;</span>
and the Lat. <i>tapetium</i>, whence also comes the Fr. <i>tapis</i> (the
present word for &ldquo;carpet&rdquo;) as well as our own word
<span class="sidenote">History.</span>
&ldquo;tapestry.&rdquo; This latter, though now more particularly descriptive
of hangings and curtains woven in a special way, was, in
later medieval times, indiscriminately applied to them and to
stuffs used as floor and seat coverings. From a very early period
classical writers make mention of them. In ancient Egypt, for
instance, floor and seat coverings were used in temples for
religious ceremonies by the priests of Amen Ra; later on they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page393" id="page393"></a>393</span>
were used to garnish the palaces of the Pharaohs. If one may
judge from rare remains of decorative textiles, in the museum
at Cairo especially, dating from at least 1480 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, such Egyptian
fabrics were of linen inwoven with coloured wools in a tapestry-weaving
manner, and were not tufted or piled textures. Taken
from the palace at Nineveh is a large marble slab carved in low
relief with a geometrical pattern surrounded by a border of lotus
flowers and buds, evidently a copy of an Assyrian floor cover or
rug about 705 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, such as was also woven probably in the
tapestry-weaving manner. On the other hand, its design
equally well suggests patchwork&mdash;a method of needlework in
vogue with Egyptians, at least 900 years <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, for ornamental
purposes, as indicated by the elaborately patterned canopy
which covered the bier of an Egyptian queen&mdash;the mother-in-law
of Shishak who took Jerusalem some three or four years after
the death of Solomon&mdash;and is preserved in the museum at Cairo.
In the <i>Odyssey, tapetia</i> are frequently mentioned, but these again,
whether floor coverings or hangings, are more likely to have been
flat-textured and not piled fabrics. On the tomb of Cyrus was
spread a &ldquo;covering of Babylonian tapestry, the carpets underneath
of the finest wrought purple&rdquo; (Arrian vi. 29). Athenaeus
(bk. v. ch. 27) gives from Callixenus the Rhodian (c. 280 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>)
an account of a banquet given by Ptolemy Philadelphus at
Alexandria, and describes &ldquo;the purple carpets of finest wool,
with the pattern on both sides,&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;handsomely
embroidered rugs very beautifully elaborated with figures&rdquo;;
these again were probably not piled fabrics but kindred to the
hangings in the palace of Ptolemy Philadelphus decorated with
portraits, which were likely to have been of tapestry-weaving,
and would be nearly the same in appearance on both sides of the
fabric. Of corresponding tapestry woven work are Egypto-Roman
specimens dating from the 2nd or 3rd century <span class="sc">a.d.</span>, a
considerable collection of which is in the Victoria and Albert
Museum at South Kensington. From about the same period
date bits of hangings or coverings woven in linen, over-wrought
in a method of needlework with ornament of compact loops of
worsted (Plate I. figs, 1 and 2). These are the earliest extant
specimens of textiles presenting a tufted or piled surface very
kindred to that of woven pile carpets of much later date. But
the <i>modus operandi</i> in producing the earlier only remotely
corresponds with that of the later&mdash;though making a surface
of loops by means of needlework as in the Coptic or Egypto-Roman
specimens of Plate I. figs, 1 and 2 seems to be a step in
a progress towards the introduction at an apparently later date
of tufts into loom weavings such as we find in 16th-century
tufted or piled carpets.</p>

<p>The simple traditional Oriental method of making these latter
is briefly as follows:&mdash;The foundation is a warp of strong cotton
or hempen or woollen or silk threads, the number of
which is regulated by the breadth of the carpet and
<span class="sidenote">Method of making piled carpets.</span>
the fineness or coarseness to be given to its pile.
Short lengths of coloured wool or goats&rsquo; or camels&rsquo;
hair or silk are knotted on to each of the warp threads so that
the two ends of each twist or tuft of coloured yarn, of whatever
material it is, project in front. Across the width of the warp
and above the range of tufts a weft thread is run in; another
line or row of tufts is then knotted, and above this another weft
thread is run in across the warps, and so on. These rows of tufts
and weft as made are compressed together by means of a blunt
fork or rude comb-like instrument, and thus a compact textile
with a pile or tufted surface is produced; the projecting tufts
are then carefully clipped to an even surface. In the East the
rude wooden frames in which the warp-threads are stretched
either stand upright upon, or are level with, the ground. They
are easily transported and put together, and the weaving in them
is done chiefly by wandering groups of weavers. The local
surroundings, often those of rocky arid districts, in which
Kurdish and other families weave carpets are well illustrated
in <i>Oriental Rugs</i> by J.H. Mumford. For making pile carpets
and rugs two traditional knots are in use; the first is termed
the Turkish or Ghiordes knot, from Ghiordes, an old city not
far from Brusa. It is in vogue principally throughout Asia
Minor, as far east as Kurdistan and the Caucasus, but it is also
used farther south-east in parts of Persia and India. The yard
of the pile is knotted in short lengths upon the warp-threads
so that the two outstanding ends of each knot alternate with
every two threads of the warp. The second traditional knot is
the Persian or Sehna knot, which, though better calculated
to produce a close, fine, even, velvety surface, has in many
parts of Persia been abandoned for the Ghiordes knot, which
is a trifle more easily tied. The Persian or Sehna knot is tied
so that from every space between the warp-threads one end of
the knot protrudes. The number of knots to the inch tied
according to either the Turkish or Persian method is determined
by the size and closeness of the warp-threads and the size and
number of weft-threads thrown across after each row of knots.
The patterns of the fabrics made by country weavers are usually
taken by them from old rugs. But in towns where weaving is
conducted under more organized conditions new patterns are
often devised, and are traced sometimes upon great cardboards,
on which the stitches, or knots, are indicated by squares each
painted in its proper colour. In some of the Persian carpets
and rugs made at Sehna, Kirman and Tabriz, the warp
is of silk, a material that contributes to fine compact pile
textures.</p>

<p>There is much uncertainty as to the period when cut pile
carpets were first made in the East. Their texture is certainly
akin to that of fustian and velvet; while that of the
finer Persian carpets, which were not made much
<span class="sidenote">Date of original pile textures.</span>
earlier than about the 15th century, is practically not
distinguishable from velvet, having long or heavy pile.
Fustian, the English name for a cut short pile textile, is derived
from Fostat (old Cairo), and such material is likely to have been
made there, as soon as anywhere else, by Saracens, especially
during the propitious times of the Fatimite Khalifs, who for more
than two centuries previously to the 13th century were noted
for the encouragement they gave to all sorts of arts and manufactures.
It seems that velvet came into use in Europe not much
earlier than the 14th century, and various French church inventories
of the time contain entries of &ldquo;<i>tapis velus</i> (cut pile carpets)
<i>d&rsquo;aultre mer, à mettre par terre</i>&rdquo; (see <i>Essai sur l&rsquo;histoire des tapisseries
et tapis</i>, by W. Chocqueel, Paris, 1863, pp. 22-23). It is an
open question if the making of cut pile carpets in Persia or by
Saracens elsewhere preceded that of fustians and velvets or
whether the developments in making the three proceeded <i>pari
passu.</i></p>

<p>The making of carpets with a flat surface, however, is probably
far older than that of cut pile carpets, and characteristic of one
such old method is that in the making of Soumak carpets
(Plate II. fig. 5), the ornament of which done in
<span class="sidenote">Carpets with flat surface.</span>
close needle stitches with coloured threads completely
conceals the stout flax or hemp web which is the
essential material of these carpets. Soumak is a distortion of
Shernaka, a Caucasian town in the far east of Asia Minor. But
so-called Soumak carpets are made in other districts, and the
particular needlework used in them is practically of the same
kind as that on a smaller scale used for the well-known Persian
Nakshe or woman&rsquo;s trousering, and again that used on a still
smaller scale in the ornamentation of valuable Kashmir shawls.
Quilted and chain-stitched cotton prayer and bath rugs from
Persia are referred to in the article on <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Embroidery</a></span>.</p>

<p>Another method of making carpets with a flat surface is that
of tapestry-weaving (see Plate II. fig. 4), which, according to
existing and well-authenticated specimens of considerable
antiquity (already referred to), appears to be the oldest of any
historic process of ornamental weaving (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Tapestry</a></span>).</p>

<p>Very broadly considered, the traditional designs or patterns
of Oriental carpets fall into two classes: the one, prevailing to
a much larger extent than the other, seems to reflect
the austerity of the Sunni or orthodox Mahommedans
<span class="sidenote">Motives in traditional designs in Oriental carpets.</span>
in making patterns with abstract geometric and
angular forms, stiff interlacing devices, cryptic signs
and symbols and the like; whilst the other suggests
the freer thought of the Shiah or unorthodox sect, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page394" id="page394"></a>394</span>
designs of ingenious blossom and leafy scrolls, conventional
arabesques, botanical and animal forms, and cartouches enclosing
Kufic inscriptions (see the splendid example known as the
Ardebil carpet, Plate III. fig. 7, and another in Plate IV. fig. 9).
Types of the more austere design occur in carpets from Afghanistan,
Turkestan, Bokhara and Asia Minor, N.W. India and
even Morocco, the other types of freer design being almost
special to Persian rugs and carpets.</p>

<p>Next in historic importance to Persia, Turkestan and Asia
Minor is India, where the making of cut pile carpets&mdash;known
as Kalin and Kalicha&mdash;was presumably introduced
by the Mahommedans during the latter part of the
<span class="sidenote">Indian Carpets.</span>
14th century. But the industry did not apparently
attain importance until after the founding of the Mogul dynasty
by Baber early in the 16th century. The designs mainly derived
from those of Persian carpets of that period do not as a rule rise
to the excellence of their prototypes. Historical centres of
Indian carpet making are in Kashmir, the Punjab and Sind,
and at Agra, Mirzapur, Jubbulpore, Warangal in the Deccan,
Malabar and Masulipatam. Velvets are richly embroidered in
gold and silver thread at Benares and Murshidabad and used as
ceremonial carpets, and silk pile carpets are made at Tanjore and
Salem. For the most part the best of the Indian woollen pile
carpets have been produced by workers of repute engaged by
princes, great nobles and wealthy persons to carry on the craft
in their dwellings and palaces. These groups of highly skilled
workers as part of the household staff were paid fixed salaries,
but they were also allowed to execute private orders. During
the 19th century the carpet industry was developed in government
gaols. Produced in great quantities the prison-made
carpets as a rule are less well turned out, and the competition,
set up between them and the rugs and carpets of private factories
has had a somewhat detrimental effect upon the industry
generally. Older in origin than the cut pile carpets are those
of thinner and flat surface texture, which from almost
immemorial times have been woven in cotton with blue and
white or blue and red stripes in the simplest way. These are
called <i>daris</i> and <i>satranjis</i>, and are made chiefly in Benares and
northern India. They are also made in the south and by such
aborigines retaining primitive habits as the Todas of the Nilgiri
Hills, a fact which points to the age of this particular method of
making ground or floor coverings.</p>

<p>A condition that has always controlled the designs of Oriental
carpets is their rectangular shape, more often oblong than
square. As a rule, there is a well-schemed border,
enclosing the main portion or field over which the
<span class="sidenote">Condition controlling designs of Oriental Carpets.</span>
details of the pattern are symmetrically distributed.
Simpler patterns in the field of a carpet or rug consist
of repetitions of the same device or of a small number
of different devices (see Plate II. fig. 4). Richer patterns
display more organic pattern in the construction, of which the
leading and continuous features are expressed as diversified
bands, scrolls and curved stems; amongst these latter are very
varied devices which play either predominant or subordinate
parts in the whole effect of the design (Plate III. fig. 7).
Angular and simplified treatments of these elaborate designs
are rendered in many Asia Minor or Turkey carpets (Plate I.
fig. 3); but the typical flowing and more graceful versions are
of Persian origin (see Plate III. fig. 7, and Plate IV. fig. 9),
usually of the 16th century. Mingled in such intricate stem
designs or &ldquo;arabesques&rdquo; are details many of which have been
derived on the one hand from Sassanian and even from far
earlier Mesopotamian emblematical ornament based on cheetahs
seizing gazelles, on floral forms, blossoms and buds so well conventionalized
in Assyrian decoration, and on the other hand
from Tatar and Chinese sources. The style, strong in suggestion
of successive historical periods, seems to have been matured
in Mosil engraved and damascened metal work of the 12th and
13th centuries before its occurrence in Persian carpet designs,
the finest of which were produced about the reign of Shah Abbas.
A good deal earlier than this period are carpets designed chiefly
according to the simpler taste of the Sunnites, and such as these
appear to be mentioned by Marco Polo (1256-1323) when
writing that &ldquo;in Turcomania they weave the handsomest carpets
in the world.&rdquo; He quotes Conia (Konieh in Anatolia), Savast
(Sivas in Asia Minor), some 300 m. north-east of Konieh, and
Cassaria (Kaisaria or Caesaraea in Anatolia) as the chief weaving
centres. It is the carpets from such places rather than from
Persia that appear to have been the first Oriental ones known in
European countries.</p>

<p>Entries of Oriental carpets are frequent in the inventories of
European cathedral treasures. In England, for instance, carpets
are said to have been first employed by Queen Eleanor
of Castile and her suite during the latter part of the
<span class="sidenote">Carpets in Europe.</span>
13th century, who had them from Spain, where their
manufacture was apparently carried on by Saracens or Moors
in the southern part of the country. On the other hand,
Pierre Dupont, a master carpet-maker of the Savonnerie (see
below), gives his opinion in 1632 that the introduction of carpet-making
into France was due to the Saracens after their defeat
by Charles Martel in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 726. But more historically precise
is the record in the book of crafts (<i>Livre des métiers</i>) by Etienne
Boileau, provost of the merchants in Paris (1258-1268), of &ldquo;the
tapicers or makers of <i>tapis sarrasinois,</i><a name="fa1c" id="fa1c" href="#ft1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a> who say that their craft
is for the service only of churches or great men like kings and
nobles.&rdquo; In the 13th and 14th centuries Saracen weavers of
rich and ornamental stuffs were also employed at Venice, which
was a chief centre for importing Oriental goods, including carpets,
and distributing them through western Europe. Dr Bode, in
his <i>Vorderasiatische Knüpfteppiche,</i> instances Oriental carpets
with patterns mainly of geometric and angular forms represented
in frescoes and other paintings by Domenico di Bartolo (1440),
Niccolo di Buonaccorso (1450), Lippo Memmi (1480) and others.</p>

<p>Of greater interest perhaps, and especially as throwing light
upon the trade, in, if not the making of, carpets in England
somewhat in the method of contemporary Turkey carpets, is
the specimen represented in Plate III. fig. 6. This may have
been made in England, where foreign workmen, especially
Flemings, were from early times often encouraged to settle in
order to develop industries, amongst which pile carpet-making
probably and tapestry-weaving certainly were included. The
earliest record of tapestry-weaving works in England is that of
William Sheldon&rsquo;s at Barcheston, Warwickshire, in 1509, and,
besides wall hangings, carpets of tapestry-weaving were also
possibly made there.<a name="fa2c" id="fa2c" href="#ft2c"><span class="sp">2</span></a> The cut pile carpet belonging to Lord
Verulam (Plate III. fig. 6) was perhaps made at Norwich. It
has a repeating and simply contrived continuous pattern of
carnations and intertwining stems with a large lozenge in the
centre bearing the royal arms of England with the letters E.R.
(Elizabeth Regina) and the date 1570. It also has the arms of
the borough of Ipswich and those of the family of Harbottle.
The sequence or continuity of its border pattern fails in the
corners at one end of the rug or carpet in a way very common
to many Asia Minor and Spanish carpets (see Plate I. fig. 3,
Plate II. fig. 4, and Plate IV. fig. 10); not, however, to the majority
of Persian carpets (see Plate III. fig. 7, and Plate IV. fig. 8). A
large cut pile carpet in the Victoria and Albert Museum has a
repeating pattern of star devices, rather Moorish in style, with
the inscription on one end of the border, &ldquo;Feare God and Keep
His Commandments, made in the yeare 1603,&rdquo; and in the field
the shield of arms of Sir Edward Apsley of Thakeham, Sussex,
impaling those of his wife, Elizabeth Elmes of Lifford, Northamptonshire.
This may have been made in England. A carpet of
very similar design, especially in its border, is to be seen in a
painting by Marc Gheeraedts of the conference at old Somerset
House of English and Spanish plenipotentiaries (1604), now in
the National Portrait Gallery, London. A more important and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page395" id="page395"></a>395</span>
finer carpet belongs to the Girdlers&rsquo; Company (Plate IV. fig. 8),
and is of Persian design, into which are introduced the arms of
the company, shields with eagles, and white panels with English
letters, the monogram of Robert Bell the master in 1634, but
this was made at Lahore<a name="fa3c" id="fa3c" href="#ft3c"><span class="sp">3</span></a> to his order.</p>

<p>Before dealing with later phases of the carpet industry in
England, mention may now be made of Spanish carpets, of
European as distinct from Saracenic or Persian
design; the making of them dates at least from the
<span class="sidenote">Spanish carpets.</span>
end of the 15th century or the beginning of the 16th
century. It is only within recent years that specimens of them
have been obtained for public collections, and at present little
is known of the factories in Spain whence they came. A large
and most interesting series is shown in the Victoria and Albert
Museum, and a portion of one of the earlier of the Spanish cut
pile carpets in that museum is given in Plate IV. fig. 10. The
inner repeating pattern has suggestions of a lingering Moorish
influence, but a superior version of it with better definition is to be
seen in extant bits of Spanish shuttle-woven silks of the 16th
century. The border of distorted dragon-like creatures is of a
Renaissance style, and this style is more pronounced in other
Spanish carpets having borders of poorly treated Italian 16th-century
pilaster ornament. Beside cut pile, many Spanish
carpets of the 17th and 18th centuries have looped and flat
surfaces, and bear Spanish names and inscriptions; many too are
of needlework in tent or cross stitch.</p>

<p>Another interesting class of very fine pile carpets that has also
become known comparatively recently to collectors is the so-called
Polish carpets, generally made of silk pile for
the ornament, which is distinctively Oriental, and of
<span class="sidenote">Polish carpets</span>
gold and silver thread textile for the ground, very
much after the manner of early 17th-century Brusa fabrics.
Many of these carpets are in the Czartoryski collection at Cracow.
They are discussed by Dr Bode in his treatise on Oriental carpets
already referred to. European coats of arms of the persons for
whom they were made are often introduced into them, sometimes
different in workmanship from that of the carpets, though there
are specimens in which the workmanship is the same throughout.
The details of their designs consist for the most part of arabesques
and long curved serrated leaves similar to such as are commonly
used in Rhodian pottery decoration of the 16th century, though
more typical of those so frequent in 17th-century Turkish
ornament. Various considerations lead to the conclusion that
these so-called Polish carpets were probably made in either
Constantinople or Damascus (<i>tapete Damaschini</i> frequently
occur in Venetian inventories of the 16th century) rather than, as
has been thought, by the Persian workmen employed at the
Mazarski silk factory which lasted for a short period only during
the 18th century at Sleucz in Poland.</p>

<p>The European carpet manufactory, of which a continuous
history for some two hundred and fifty years is recorded with
exceptional completeness, is that which has been
maintained under successive regimes, royal, imperial
<span class="sidenote">Carpets made in France.</span>
and republican, in France&mdash;at the Hotel des Gobelins
in Paris. Seventy years before its organization under
Colbert in 1667 as a state manufactory (<i>Manufacture Royale des
Meubles de la Couronne</i>), Henry IV. had founded royal art workshops
for all sorts of decorative work, at the Louvre; and here in
1604 a workroom was established for making Oriental carpets by
the side of that which existed for making <i>tapis flamands</i>. In
1610 letters patent were granted to the Sieur Fortier, who has
been reputed to be the first inventor in France of the art of
making in silk and wool real Turkey and other piled carpets with
grounds of gold thread, which must have been sumptuous
fabrics probably resembling the so-called Polish carpets of this
date. Some ten years later it is recorded that Pierre Dupont and
Simon Lourdet started a pile carpet (<i>tapis veloutés</i>) manufactory
at Chaillot (Paris) in large premises which had been used for the
manufacture of soap&mdash;whence the name of &ldquo;Savonnerie.&rdquo; To
this converted manufactory were transferred in 1631 the carpet-makers
from the Louvre, and under the direct patronage of the
crown it continued its operations for many years at Chaillot. It
was not until 1828 that the making of <i>tapis de la Savonnerie</i>
(pile carpets of a fine velvety character) was transferred to the
Hôtel des Gobelins. Here, in contradistinction to the Savonnerie,
carpets are made others which, like those of Beauvais (where
a manufactory of hangings and carpets was established by
Colbert in 1664), are <i>tapis ras</i> or non-piled carpets, being of
tapestry-weaving, as also are those made by old-established
firms at Aubusson and at Felletin, where the manufacture
was flourishing, at the former place in 1732 and at the latter
in 1737.</p>

<p>Returning now to England, there are evidences towards the
end of the 17th century, if not earlier, that Walloon and Flemish
makers of Turkey pile carpets had settled and set up works in
different parts of the country. A protective charter, for instance,
was granted in 1701 by William III. to weavers in Axminster and
Wilton. The ultimate celebrity of the pile carpet industry at
Wilton was due mainly to the interest taken in it during the
earlier part of the 18th century by Henry, earl of Pembroke and
Montgomery, who in the course of his travels abroad collected
certain French and Walloon carpet-makers to work for him in
Wiltshire&mdash;over them he put two Frenchmen, Antoine Dufossy
and Pierre Jemale. More notable, however, than these is Pere
Norbert, who naturalized himself as an Englishman, changed his
name to Parisot, and started a manufactory of pile carpets and a
training school in the craft at Fulham about 1751. In 1753 he
wrote and published &ldquo;An account of the new manufactory of
Tapestry after the manner of that at the Gobelins, and of carpets
after the manner of that at Chaillot (<i>i.e.</i> Savonnerie) now undertaken
at Fulham by Mr Peter Parisot.&rdquo; Two refugee French
carpet-makers from the Savonnerie had arrived in London in
1750, and started weaving a specimen carpet in Westminster.
Parisot, having found them out, induced the duke of Cumberland
to furnish funds for their removal to better workrooms at
Paddington. The carpet when finished was presented by the
duke to the princess dowager of Wales. Parisot quarrelled with
his two employees, enticed others to come over, and then removed
the carpet works from Paddington to Fulham. A worker,
J. Baptiste Grignon, writing to &ldquo;Mr Parisot in Foulleme Manufactory,&rdquo;
mentions the marked preference &ldquo;shown by the
English court for velvet,&rdquo; and how much a &ldquo;chair-back he had
worked in the manner of the Savonnerie had been admired.&rdquo;
Correspondence published in the <i>Nouvelles Archives de l&rsquo;art
français </i>(1878) largely relates to the efforts of the French government
to stop the emigration to England of workers from the
Gobelins and the Savonnerie. Parisot&rsquo;s Fulham works were sold
up in 1755. He then tried to start a manufactory at Exeter, but
apparently without success, as in 1756 his Exeter stock was sold
in the Great Piazza auction rooms, Covent Garden. Joseph
Baretti (Dr Johnson&rsquo;s friend), writing from Plymouth on the
18th of April 1760, alludes to his having that morning visited
the Exeter manufactory of <i>tapisseries de Gobelins</i> &ldquo;founded by
a distinguished anti-Jesuit&mdash;the renowned Father Nobert.&rdquo;
Previously to this a Mr Passavant of Exeter<a name="fa4c" id="fa4c" href="#ft4c"><span class="sp">4</span></a> had received in
1758 a premium from the Society of Arts of London for making a
carpet in &ldquo;imitation of those brought from the East and called
Turky carpets.&rdquo; Similar premiums had been awarded by the
society in 1757 to a Mr Moore of Chiswell Street, Moorfields, and
to a Mr Whitty of Axminster. In 1759 a society&rsquo;s premium was
won by Mr Jeffer of Frome. In the <i>Transactions of the Society,</i>
vol. i., dated 1783, it is stated that by their rewards, the manufacture
of &ldquo;Turky carpets is now established in different parts of
the kingdom, and brought to a degree of elegance and beauty
which the Turky carpets never attained.&rdquo; Such records as
these convey a fair notion of the sporadic attempts which immediately
preceded a systematic manufacture of pile carpets in
this country. Whilst the Wilton industry survived, that actually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page396" id="page396"></a>396</span>
carried on at Axminster died towards the end of the 18th century,
and the name of Axminster like that of Savonnerie carpets now
perpetuates the memory of a locally deceased manufactory,
much as in a parallel way Brussels carpets seem to owe their name
to the renown of Brussels as an important centre in the 15th and
16th centuries for tapestry-weaving.</p>

<p>Before the existence of steam-driven carpet-making machinery
in England, employers, following the example set by the French,
applied the Jacquard apparatus, for regulating and
facilitating the weaving of patterns, to the hand
<span class="sidenote">Modern machinery.</span>
manufacture of carpets. This was early in the 19th
century; a great acceleration in producing English carpets occurred,
severely threatening the industry as pursued (largely for
<i>tapis ras</i>) at Tournai in Belgium, at Nimes, Abbeville, Aubusson,
Beauvais, Tourcoing and Lannoy in France. The severity of
the competition, however, was still more increased when English
enterprise, developing the inventions of Erastus B. Bigelow
(1814-1879) of America and Mr William Wood of England,
took the lead in perfecting Jacquard weaving carpet looms
worked by steam, which resulted in the setting up of many power-loom
carpet manufactories in the United Kingdom. It was
not until 1880 that French pile carpet manufacturers began
to adopt similar carpet power-looms, importing them from
England.</p>

<p>These machines for weaving pile carpets, either looped (<i>bouclé</i>)
as in Brussels, or cut (<i>velouté</i>) as in Wilton or Axminster carpets,
were similar in all respects to such as had been in use by the
important English manufacturers&mdash;Crossley of Halifax, Templeton
of Glasgow, Humphreys of Kidderminster, Southwell of Bridgnorth,
and others. A so-called tapestry carpet weaving-loom
was invented by Richard Whytock of Edinburgh in 1832, but
it was not brought to sufficient completeness for sustained
manufacture until 1855. The essential feature of Mr Whytock&rsquo;s
process was that the warp-threads were dyed and parti-coloured,
in such a way that when woven the several points of colour
formed the pattern of the whole fabric. Although the name
&ldquo;tapestry&rdquo; is used, the texture of these wares has but a remote
likeness to that of hand-made tapestry hangings and carpets
such as those of the Gobelins and Aubusson manufactories, nor
is it the same as the texture of Brussels carpets. Machine-made
tapestry carpets are also called &ldquo;ingrain&rdquo; carpets, because the
wool or worsted is dyed in the grain, <i>i.e.</i> before manufacture.
Germany in her manufacture of carpets resorts chiefly to the
&ldquo;ingrain&rdquo; process, but in common with Holland and Belgium
she produces pile (looped and cut) carpets from power-looms.
In the United States of America there are many similar and very
important carpet manufactories; and Austria produces fine cut
pile carpets (<i>veloutés</i>), the designs of which are largely derived
from those of the Aubusson tapestry-woven carpets (<i>tapis ras</i>).</p>

<p>Lengths or pieces of felt and other substantial material are
frequently made for floor and stair carpeting, and are often
printed with patterns. These of course come into quite another
class technically. The technological aspects of the several
branches of carpet manufacture by machinery are treated in
the articles on <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Textile-printing</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Weaving</a></span>. Briefly, the
products of carpet manufacture practically fall into three main
divisions: (1) Pile carpets (<i>tapis moquettes</i>) which are either
looped (<i>bouclé</i>) or cut (<i>velouté</i>); (2) flat surface carpets
(<i>tapis ras</i>) as in hand tapestry-woven material; and (3) printed stuffs
used for carpeting.</p>

<p>Whilst the production of carpets by steam power predominates
in Europe and the United States of America, and at
one time appeared to be giving the <i>coup de grâce</i> to
the craft of making carpets by hand, there has been in
<span class="sidenote">Modern hand-made carpets.</span>
recent times a revival in this latter, and many carpets
of characteristic modern design, several of them
made in England, are due to the influence of the late William
Morris, who devoted much of his varied energies to tapestry
weaving and pile carpet weaving by hand, both of which crafts
are being fostered as cottage industries in parts of Ireland, as
well as in England. At the same time leading English carpet
manufactures continue to produce hand-made carpets as
occasion requires. In France a much more systematic existence
of tapestry weaving and pile carpet making by hand has been
maintained and is of course attributable to the perennial activity
of the state tapestry works in Paris (at the Gobelins workshops)
and in Beauvais, and of corresponding works managed by private
enterprise at Aubusson and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Designing patterns for English carpet manufacture is now
more organized than it was, and greater thought and invention
are given to devising ornament suitable to the purpose of floor
coverings. Before 1850 and for a few years later, rather rude
realistic representations of animals and botanical forms (decadent
versions of Savonnerie designs) were often wrought in rugs and
carpets, and survivals of these are still to be met with, but the
lessons that have been subsequently derived from intelligent study
of Oriental designs have resulted in the definite designing of
conventional forms for surface patterns. The early movement
in this direction owes much to the teaching of Owen Jones,
and in its later and rather freer phases the Morris influence has
been powerful. Schools of art at Glasgow, at Manchester, Birmingham
and elsewhere in the United Kingdom have trained
and continue to train designers, whose work has contributed
to the formation of an English style with a new note, which, as
a French writer puts it, has created a sensation in France, in
Germany, in fact in all Europe and America.</p>

<p>France retains that facility of execution and liveliness in
invention which have been nurtured for over three hundred
years by systematic, governmental solicitude for education
in decorative design and enterprise in perfecting manufacture.
Her Aubusson and Savonnerie carpets have maintained a style
of design in form and colour entirely different from any that
clearly throws back to Oriental principles, and many of the
designs for the finer and larger of these carpets are schemed
with large central oval panels, garlands of flowers and fantastic
frames very much on the plan of what is frequently to be seen
in the decoration of ceilings. At the same time the style called
<i>l&rsquo;art nouveau</i> has become developed. It largely grows from
very fanciful dispositions of free-growing natural forms, as well
as curiously curved and tenuous forms, many of which are
bone-like and fibre-like in character, flat in treatment and rather
thin and washy in colour, and its influence has slightly percolated
into designs for pile carpets. This style, sometimes intermixed
with the more robust, less fantastic and rather fuller-coloured
English style, has found followers in England, America and
Germany, but the bulk of the designs now used in power carpet
looms seems to be mainly of Oriental descent.</p>

<p>The more important art museums in Europe contain collections
of Oriental carpets, and the history of many is fairly well established. The subject has become one of serious study, the results
of which have been published and elucidated by means of well-executed
coloured reproductions of carpets and rugs preserved
in both public and private collections.</p>

stands as a candidate for election in a locality in which he is a

by the central party organization. The term was first used in
the western states of America of speculative bankers who were
said to have started business with no other property than what
they could carry in a carpet-bag, and absconded when they
failed. The term became of general use in American politics
in the reconstruction period after the Civil War, as a term

<p><span class="bold">CARPI, GIROLAMO DA<a name="ar38" id="ar38"></a></span> (1501-1556), Italian historical and
portrait painter, born at Ferrara, was one of Benvenuto Garofalo&rsquo;s
best pupils. Becoming infatuated with the work of Correggio,
he quitted Ferrara, and spent several years in copying
that master&rsquo;s paintings at Parma, Modena and elsewhere,
succeeding in aping his mannerisms so well as to be able to
dispose of his own works as originals by Correggio. It is probable
that not a few pictures yet attributed to the great painter are in
reality the work of his parasite. Da Carpi&rsquo;s best paintings are
a Descent of the Holy Spirit, in the church of St Francis at
Rovigo; a Madonna, an Adoration of the Magi, and a St
Catharine, at Bologna; and the St George and the St Jerome,
at Ferrara.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CARPI, UGO DA,<a name="ar39" id="ar39"></a></span> Italian 15th-century painter, was long held the
inventor of the art of printing in chiaroscuro, afterwards brought
to such perfection by Parmigiano and by Baltasar Peruzzi of
Siena. The researches of Michael Huber (1727-1804) and Johann
Gottlob Immanuel Breitkopf (1719-1794) have proved, however,
that this art was known and practised in Germany by Johann
Ulrich Pilgrim (Wächtlin) and Nikolaus Alexander Mair (1450-c. 1520),
at least as early as 1499, while the date of the oldest
of Da Carpi&rsquo;s prints is 1518. Printing in chiaroscuro is performed
by using several blocks. Da Carpi usually employed three&mdash;one
for the outline and darker shadows, another for the lighter
shadows, and a third for the half-tint. By means of them he
printed engravings after several pictures and after some of the
cartoons of Raphael. Of these a Sybil, a Descent from the
Cross, and a History of Simon the Sorcerer are the most
remarkable.</p>

was refused they invaded in force, but were beaten back by the
emperor Philip. After this they joined with the Goths in their
successful inroads until both nations were defeated by Claudius
Gothicus. Later, after repeated defeats under Diocletian and
Galerius, they were taken under Roman protection and the
greater part established in the provinces of Pannonia and
Moesia; some were left beyond the Danube, and they are last
heard of as allies of the Huns and Sciri in the time of Theodosius
I. Ptolemy speaks of Harpii and a town Harpis. This was no
doubt the form the name assumed in the mouths of their
Germanic neighbours, Bastarnae and Goths.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARPI,<a name="ar41" id="ar41"></a></span> a town and episcopal see of Emilia, Italy, in the
province of Modena, 9 m. N.N.W. by rail from the town of
Modena. Pop. (1905) 7118 (town), 27,135 (commune). It is
the junction of a branch line to Reggio nell&rsquo; Emilia via Correggio,
and the centre of a fertile agricultural district. Carpi contains
several Renaissance buildings of interest, the façade of the old
cathedral (an early Romanesque building in origin, with some
early 15th-century frescoes), the new cathedral (after 1513),
perhaps the nave of S. Niccolò and a palace, all being by
Baldassare Peruzzi: while the prince&rsquo;s palace (with a good
court and a chapel containing frescoes by Bernardino Loschi of
Parma, 1489-1540) and the colonnades opposite the theatre
are also good. These, and the fortifications, are all due to
Alberto Pio of Carpi, a pupil of Aldus Manutius, expelled in
1525 by Charles V., the principality being given to the house of
Este.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CARPINI, JOANNES DE PLANO,<a name="ar42" id="ar42"></a></span> the first noteworthy European
explorer of the Mongol empire (in the 13th century),
and the author of the earliest important Western work on
northern and central Asia, Russian Europe, and other regions
of the Tatar dominion. He appears to have been a native of
Umbria, where a place formerly called Pian del Carpine, but now
Piano della Magione, stands near Perugia, on the road to Cortona.
He was one of the companions and disciples of his countryman
St Francis of Assisi, and from sundry indications can hardly
have been younger than the latter, born in 1182. Joannes bore
a high repute in the order, and took a foremost part in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page398" id="page398"></a>398</span>
propagation of its teaching in northern Europe, holding successively
the offices of warden (<i>custos</i>) in Saxony, and of provincial
(<i>minister</i>) of Germany, and afterwards of Spain, perhaps of
Barbary, and of Cologne. He was in the last post at the time of
the great Mongol invasion of eastern Europe and of the disastrous
battle of Liegnitz (April 9, 1241), which threatened to cast
European Christendom beneath the feet of barbarous hordes.
The dread of the Tatars was, however, still on men&rsquo;s mind four
years later, when Pope Innocent IV. despatched the first formal
Catholic mission to the Mongols (1245), partly to protest against
the latter&rsquo;s invasion of Christian lands, partly to gain trustworthy
information regarding the hordes and their purposes; behind
there may have lurked the beginnings of a policy much developed
in after-time&mdash;that of opening diplomatic intercourse with a
power whose alliance might be invaluable against Islam.</p>

<p>At the head of this mission the pope placed Friar Joannes,
at this time certainly not far from sixty-five years of age; and
to his discretion nearly everything in the accomplishment of
the mission seems to have been left. The legate started from
Lyons, where the pope then resided, on Easter day (April 16,
1245), accompanied by another friar, one Stephen of Bohemia,
who broke down at Kanev near Kiev, and was left behind.
After seeking counsel of an old friend, Wenceslaus, king of
Bohemia, Carpini was joined at Breslau by another Minorite,
Benedict the Pole, appointed to act as interpreter. The onward
journey lay by Kiev; the Tatar posts were entered at
Kanev; and thence the route ran across the Dnieper (<i>Neper,
Nepere</i>, in Carpini and Benedict) to the Don and Volga (<i>Ethil</i> in
Benedict; Carpini is the first Western to give us the modern
name). Upon the last-named stood the <i>Ordu</i> or camp of Batu,
the famous conqueror of eastern Europe, and the supreme
Mongol commander on the western frontiers of the empire, as
well as one of the most senior princes of the house of Jenghiz.
Here the envoys, with their presents, had to pass between two
fires, before being presented to the prince (beginning of April
1246). Batu ordered them to proceed onward to the court of
the supreme khan in Mongolia; and on Easter day once more
(April 8, 1246) they started on the second and most formidable
part of their journey&mdash;&ldquo;so ill,&rdquo; writes the legate, &ldquo;that we could
scarcely sit a horse; and throughout all that Lent our food had
been nought but millet with salt and water, and with only snow
melted in a kettle for drink.&rdquo; Their bodies were tightly bandaged
to enable them to endure the excessive fatigue of this enormous
ride, which led them across the <i>Jaec</i> or Ural river, and north of
the Caspian and the Aral to the Jaxartes or Syr Daria (<i>quidam
fluvius magnus cujus nomen ignoramus</i>), and the Mahommedan
cities which then stood on its banks; then along the shores of
the Dzungarian lakes; and so forward, till, on the feast of St
Mary Magdalene (July 22), they reached at last the imperial
camp called <i>Sira Orda</i> (<i>i.e.</i> Yellow Pavilion), near Karakorum
and the Orkhon river&mdash;this stout-hearted old man having thus
ridden something like 3000 m. in 106 days.</p>

<p>Since the death of Okkodai the imperial authority had been
in <i>interregnum</i>. Kuyuk, Okkodai&rsquo;s eldest son, had now been
designated to the throne; his formal election in a great <i>Kurultai</i>,
or diet of the tribes, took place while the friars were at Sira Orda,
along with 3000 to 4000 envoys and deputies from all parts of
Asia and eastern Europe, bearing homage, tribute and presents.
They afterwards, on the 24th of August, witnessed the formal
enthronement at another camp in the vicinity called the Golden
Ordu, after which they were presented to the emperor. It was
not till November that they got their dismissal, bearing a letter
to the pope in Mongol, Arabic and Latin, which was little else
than a brief imperious assertion of the khan&rsquo;s office as the scourge
of God. Then commenced their long winter journey homeward;
often they had to lie on the bare snow, or on the ground scraped
bare of snow with the traveller&rsquo;s foot. They reached Kiev on the
9th of June 1247. There, and on their further journey, the
Slavonic Christians welcomed them as risen from the dead, with
festive hospitality. Crossing the Rhine at Cologne, they found
the pope still at Lyons, and there delivered their report and the
khan&rsquo;s letter.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards Friar Joannes was rewarded with the
archbishopric of Antivari in Dalmatia, and was sent as legate
to St Louis. The date of his death may be fixed, with the help
of the <i>Franciscan Martyrology</i> and other authorities, as the 1st
of August 1252; hence it is clear that John did not long survive
the hardships of his journey.</p>

<p>He recorded the information that he had collected in a work,
variously entitled in the MSS. <i>Historia Mongalorum quos nos
Tartaros appellamus</i>, and <i>Liber Tartarorum</i>, or <i>Tatarorum</i>. This
treatise is divided into eight ample chapters on the country,
climate, manners, religion, character, history, policy and tactics
of the Tatars, and on the best way of opposing them, followed by
a single (ninth) chapter on the regions passed through. The
book thus answers to its title. Like some other famous medieval
itineraries it shows an entire absence of a traveller&rsquo;s or author&rsquo;s
egotism, and contains, even in the last chapter, scarcely any
personal narrative. Carpini was not only an old man when
he went cheerfully upon this mission, but was, as we know
from accidental evidence in the annals of his order, a fat and
heavy man (<i>vir gravis et corpulentus</i>), insomuch that during his
preachings in Germany he was fain, contrary to Franciscan precedent,
to ride a donkey. Yet not a word approaching more
nearly to complaint than those which we have quoted above
appears in his narrative. His book, both as to personal and
geographical detail, is inferior to that written a few years later
by a younger brother of the same Order, Louis IX.&rsquo;s most
noteworthy envoy to the Mongols, William of Rubrouck or
Rubruquis. But in spite of these defects, due partly to his conception
of his task, and in spite of the credulity with which he
incorporates the Oriental tales, sometimes of childish absurdity,
from which Rubruquis is so free, Friar Joannes&rsquo; <i>Historia</i> is in
many ways the chief literary memorial of European overland
expansion before Marco Polo. It first revealed the Mongol
world to Catholic Christendom; its account of Tatar manners,
customs and history is perhaps the best treatment of the
subject by any Christian writer of the middle ages. We may
especially notice, moreover, its four name-lists:&mdash;of the nations
conquered by the Mongols; of the nations which had up to this
time (1245-1247) successfully resisted; of the Mongol princes;
and of the witnesses to the truth of his narrative, including
various merchants trading in Kiev whom he had met. All these
catalogues, unrivalled in Western medieval literature, are of the
utmost historical value. To the accuracy of Carpini&rsquo;s statements
upon Mongol life, a modern educated Mongol, Galsang Gomboyev,
has borne detailed and interesting testimony (see <i>Mélanges asiat.
tirés du Bullet. Hist. Philol. de l&rsquo;Acad. Imp. de St Pétersbourg</i>,
ii. p. 650, 1856).</p>

<p>The book must have been prepared immediately after the
return of the traveller, for the Friar Salimbeni, who met him in
France in the year of his return (1247), gives us these interesting
particulars:&mdash;&ldquo;He was a clever and conversable man, well
lettered, a great discourser, and full of a diversity of experience....
He wrote a big book about the Tattars (<i>sic</i>), and about other
marvels that he had seen, and whenever he felt weary of telling
about the Tattars, he would cause that book of his to be read, as
I have often heard and seen&rdquo; (&ldquo;Chron. Fr. Salimbeni Parmensis&rdquo;
in <i>Monum. Histor. ad Prov. et Placent. pertinentia</i>, Parma, 1857).</p>

<p>For a long time the work was but partially known, and that
chiefly through an abridgment in the vast compilation of Vincent
of Beauvais (<i>Speculum Historiale</i>) made in the generation
following the traveller&rsquo;s own, and printed first in 1473. Hakluyt
(1598) and Bergeron (1634) published portions of the original
work; but the complete and genuine text was not printed till
1838, when it was put forth by the late M. D&rsquo;Avezac, an editorial
masterpiece, embodied (1839) in the 4th volume of the <i>Recueil
de voyages et de mémoires</i> of the Geographical Society of Paris.</p>

<p>Joannes&rsquo; companion, Benedictus Polonus, also left a brief
narrative taken down from his oral relation. This was first
published by M. D&rsquo;Avezac in the work just named.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CARPOCRATES,<a name="ar43" id="ar43"></a></span> a Gnostic of the 2nd century, about whose
life and opinions comparatively little is known. He is said to
have been a native of Alexandria and by birth a Jew. His
family, however, seem to have been converted to Christianity.
With Epiphanes, his son, he was the leader of a philosophic
school basing its theories mainly upon Platonism, and striving
to amalgamate Plato&rsquo;s <i>Republic</i> with the Christian ideal of
human brotherhood. The image of Jesus was crowned along
with those of Pythagoras, Plato and Aristotle. Carpocrates
made especial use of the doctrines of reminiscence and pre-existence
of souls. He regarded the world as formed by inferior
spirits who are out of harmony with the supreme unity, knowledge
of which is the true <i>Gnosis</i>. The souls which remember their
pre-existing state can attain to this contemplation of unity,
and thereby rise superior to all the ordinary doctrines of religion
or life. Jesus is but a man in whom this reminiscence is unusually
strong, and who has consequently attained to unusual spiritual
excellence and power. To the Gnostic the things of the world
are worthless; they are to him matters of indifference. From
this position it easily followed that actions, being merely external,
were morally indifferent, and that the true Gnostic should
abandon himself to every lust with perfect indifference. The
express declaration of these antinomian principles is said to have
been given by Epiphanes. The notorious licentiousness of the
sect was the carrying out of their theory into practice.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CARPZOV<a name="ar44" id="ar44"></a></span> (Latinized <i>Carpzovius</i>), the name of a family, many
of whose members attained distinction in Saxony in the 17th
and 18th centuries as jurists, theologians and statesmen. The
family traced its origin to Simon Carpzov, who was burgomaster
of Brandenburg in the middle of the 16th century, and who left
two sons, Joachim (d. 1628), master-general of the ordnance in
the service of the king of Denmark, and <span class="sc">Benedikt</span> (1565-1624),
an eminent jurist.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Benedikt Carpzov</span> was born in Brandenburg on the 22nd
of October 1565, and after studying at Frankfort and Wittenberg,
and visiting other German universities, was made doctor
of laws at Wittenberg in 1590. He was admitted to the faculty
of law in 1592, appointed professor of institutions in 1599, and
promoted to the chair <i>Digesti infortiati et novi</i> in 1601. In
1602 he was summoned by Sophia, widow of the elector
Christian I. of Saxony, to her court at Colditz, as chancellor, and
was at the same time appointed councillor of the court of appeal
at Dresden. After the death of the electress in 1623 he returned
to Wittenberg, and died there on the 26th of November 1624,
leaving five sons. He published a collection of writings entitled
<i>Disputationes juridicae</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Benedikt Carpzov</span> (1595-1666), second of the name, was the
second son of the preceding, and like him was a great lawyer.
He was born at Wittenberg on the 27th of May 1595, was at first
a professor at Leipzig, obtained an honourable post at Dresden
in 1639, became ordinary of the faculty of jurists at Leipzig
in 1645, and was named privy councillor at Dresden in 1653.
Among his works which had a very extensive influence on the
administration of justice, even beyond the limits of Saxony, are
<i>Definitiones forenses</i> (1638), <i>Practica nova Imperialis Saxonica
rerum criminalium</i> (1635), <i>Opus decisionum illustrium Saxoniae</i>
(1646), <i>Processus juris Saxonici</i> (1657), and others. He did
much, both by his writings and by his official work, to systematize
the body of German jurisprudence which had resulted from the
intersection of the common law of Saxony with the Roman and
Canon laws. His last years were spent at Leipzig, and his time
was entirely devoted to sacred studies. He read the Bible
through fifty-three times, studying also the comments of Osiander
and Cramer, and making voluminous notes. These have been
allowed to remain in manuscript. He died at Leipzig on the
30th of August 1666.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Johann Benedikt Carpzov</span> (1607-1657), fourth son of the first
Benedikt, was born at Rochlitz in 1607. He became professor
of theology at Leipzig in 1643, made himself chiefly known by
his <i>Isagoge in Libros Ecclesiarum Lutheranarum Symbolicos</i> (published
in 1665), and died at Leipzig on the 22nd of October 1657,
leaving five sons, all of whom attained some literary eminence.</p>

<p><span class="sc">August Carpzov</span> (1612-1683), fifth son of the first Benedikt,
distinguished himself as a diplomatist. Born at Colditz on the
4th of June 1612, he studied at the universities of Wittenberg,
Leipzig and Jena, and in 1637 was appointed advocate of the
court of justice (<i>Hofgericht</i>) at Wittenberg. Entering the service
of Frederick William II., duke of Saxe-Altenburg, he took part
in the negotiations which led to the peace of Westphalia in 1648,
and was appointed chancellor by the duke in 1649. From 1672
to 1680 he was chief minister of Ernest I. and Frederick I.,
dukes of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, and died at Coburg on the 19th

<p><span class="bold">CARRANZA, BARTOLOMÉ<a name="ar45" id="ar45"></a></span> (1503-1576), Spanish theologian,
sometimes called de Miranda or de Carranza y Miranda, younger
son of Pedro Carranza, a man of noble family, was born at
Miranda d&rsquo;Arga, Navarre, in 1503. He studied (1515-1520)
at Alcalá, where Sancho Carranza, his uncle, was professor;
entering (1520) the Dominican order, and then (1521-1525)
at Salamanca and at Valladolid, where from 1527 he was teacher
of theology. No Spaniard save Melchior Canus rivalled him in
learning; students from all parts of Spain flocked to hear him.
In 1530 he was denounced to the Inquisition as limiting the papal
power and leaning to opinions of Erasmus, but the process failed;
he was made professor of philosophy and (1533-1539) regent
in theology. In 1539, as representative to the chapter-general
of his order he visited Rome; here he was made doctor of theology,
and while he mixed with the liberal circle associated with
Juan de Valdés, he had also the confidence of Paul III. Returning
to Valladolid, he acted as censor (<i>cualificador</i>) of books
(including versions of the Bible) for the Inquisition. In 1540
he was nominated to the sees of Canaria and of Cusco, Peru,
but declined both. Charles V. chose him as envoy to the council
of Trent (1546). He insisted on the imperative duty of bishops
and clergy to reside in their benefices, publishing at Venice
(1547) his discourse to the council <i>De necessaria residentia
personali</i>, which he treated as <i>juris divini</i>. His Lenten sermon
to the council, on justification, caused much remark. He was
made provincial of his order for Castile. Charles sent him to
England (1554) with his son Philip on occasion of the marriage
with Mary. He became Mary&rsquo;s confessor, and laboured earnestly
for the re-establishment of the old religion, especially in Oxford.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page400" id="page400"></a>400</span>
In 1557 Philip appointed him to the archbishopric of Toledo; he
accepted with reluctance, and was consecrated at Brussels on
the 27th of February 1558. He was at the deathbed of Charles V.
(21st of September) and gave him extreme unction; then raised
a curious controversy as to whether Charles, in his last moments,
had been infected with Lutheranism. The same year he was
again denounced to the Inquisition, on the ground of his <i>Comentarios
sobre el Catechismo</i> (Antwerp, 1558), which in 1563, however,
was approved by a commission of the council of Trent. He had
evidently lost favour with Philip, by whose order he was arrested
at Tordelaguna (1559) and imprisoned for nearly eight years,
and the book was placed on the Index. The process dragged on.
Carranza appealed to Rome, was taken thither in December 1566,
and confined for ten years in the castle of St Angelo. The final
judgment found no proof of heresy, but compelled him to abjure
sixteen errors, rather extorted than extracted from his writings,
suspended him from his see for five years, and secluded him to
the Dominican cloister of Sta Maria sopra Minerva. Seven
days after his abjuration he died, on the 2nd of May 1576. He
was succeeded in his see by the inquisitor-general, Gaspar
Quiroga. Yet the Spanish people honoured him as a saint;
Gregory XIII. placed a laudatory inscription on his tomb in
the church of Sta Maria. His real crime was not heresy but
reform. His <i>Summa Conciliorum et Pontificum</i> (Venice, 1546) has
been often reprinted (as late as 1821), and has permanent value.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARRARA,<a name="ar46" id="ar46"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Carraresi</span>, a powerful family of Longobard
origin which ruled Padua in the 14th century. They take their
name from the village of Carrara near Padua, and the first
recorded member of the house is Gamberto (d. before 970).
In the wars between Guelphs and Ghibellines the Carraresi
at first took the latter side, but they subsequently went over
to the Guelphs. This brought them into conflict with Ezzelino
da Romano; Jacopo da Carrara was besieged by Ezzelino in
his castle of Agna, and while trying to escape was drowned.
Another Jacopo led the Paduans in 1312 against Cangrande
della Scala, lord of Verona, and though taken prisoner managed
to negotiate a peace in 1318. To put an end to the perpetual
civil strife the Paduans elected him their lord, and he seems to
have governed well, leaving the city at his death (1324) to his
nephew Marsiglio a man famed for his cunning. But Cangrande
was bent on acquiring Padua, and Marsiglio, unable to resist,
gave it over to him and was appointed its governor. Cangrande
died in 1319, being succeeded by his nephew Martino, and
Marsiglio soon began to meditate treachery; he negotiated with
the Venetians in 1336, and in the following year he secretly introduced
Venetian troops into Padua, arrested Alberto della
Scala, Martino&rsquo;s brother, then in charge of the town, and thus
regained the lordship. He died in 1338, and was succeeded by
his relative Ubertino, a typical medieval tyrant, who earned an
unenviable notoriety for his murders and acts of treachery,
but was also a patron of the arts; he built the Palazzo dei
Principi, the castle of Este, constructed a number of roads and
canals, and protected commerce. He died in 1345. His distant
kinsman Marsiglietto da Carrara succeeded to him, but was
immediately assassinated by Jacopo da Carrara, a prince famed
as the friend of Petrarch. In 1350 Jacopo was murdered by
Guglielmo da Carrara, and his brother Jacopino succeeded,
reigning together with his nephew Francesco.</p>

<p>In 1355 Francesco (il Vecchio) rose against his uncle and
imprisoned him. Francesco changed the traditional policy of
his house by quarrelling with the Venetians, in the hope of obtaining
more advantages from the Visconti of Milan. When the
former were at war with Hungary over Dalmatia in 1356 and
asked Carrara to help them, he refused. Their resentment
was all the more bitter when at the instance of the pope he
mediated between them and Hungary and brought about
peace on terms unfavourable to the republic. He received
Feltre, Belluno and Cividale from the Hungarian king, but
in 1369 a frontier dispute led to war between him and Venice.
After some defeats, Venice was victorious and dictated peace;
Carrara had to pay a huge indemnity and ask the republic&rsquo;s
pardon (1373). In 1378 he joined the league against Venice
formed by Genoa, Hungary and the Scala, and took part in the
siege of Chioggia. But the Venetians were victorious, and by
the peace of Turin Carrara found himself in the <i>status quo ante</i>,
but he bought Treviso from Austria, to whom Venice had given it
in the day of her trouble. In 1385 the Venetians set the Scala
against Carrara, who thereupon allied himself with the treacherous
Gian Galeazzo Visconti. The Scala were expelled from
Verona, but Carrara and Visconti quarrelled over the division
of the spoils. Visconti was determined to capture Padua as
well as Verona, and made an alliance with Venice and the house
of Este for the purpose. Francesco, seeing that the situation
was hopeless, surrendered to Visconti, in whose hands he remained
a prisoner until his death in 1392.</p>

<p>Francesco Novello, his son, resisted bravely, but was compelled
to surrender owing to dissensions in Padua itself. He was forced
to renounce his dominions, and received a castle near Asti,
but he escaped to France, and after a series of romantic
adventures succeeded in making peace with Venice, who was
becoming alarmed at the restless ambition and treachery of
Visconti; in 1390 he raised a small armed force and seized
Padua, where he was enthusiastically welcomed by the citizens,
and for several years reigned there in peace. But in 1399
Visconti recommenced his wars of conquest, which were to have
included Padua had not death cut short his schemes in 1402.
Carrara then allied himself with Guglielmo Scala, seized Verona,
and tried to capture Vicenza. But the Vicentini had always
hated the Carraresi, and after a short siege gave themselves over
to Venice. This led to a war between that republic and Padua,
for now that Visconti was dead the Venetians had no longer
any reason to protect Carrara. Padua and Verona were besieged;
the latter, defended by Novello&rsquo;s son Jacopo, was soon captured.
Novello himself, besieged in his capital, although repeatedly
offered favourable terms, held out for some months hoping for
help from Florence and also from certain Venetian nobles with
whom he was intriguing. Hunger, plague, the treachery
of his captains and internal discontent at last forced him to
surrender (November 1405). He and his sons Francesco III.
and Jacopo were conveyed to Venice, and at first treated with
consideration; but when their intrigues with Venetian traitors
for the overthrow of the republic came to light, they were tried,
condemned, and strangled in prison (1406). Novello&rsquo;s other
son Marsiglio made a desperate attempt to recover Padua in
1435, but was discovered and killed. With him the house of
Carrara ceased from troubling.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARRARA,<a name="ar47" id="ar47"></a></span> a town of Tuscany, Italy, in the province of
Massa e Carrara, 390 ft. above sea-level, 3 m. by rail N.N.E.
of Avenza, which is 16 m. E.S.E. of Spezia. Pop. (1881) 26,325;
(1905) town, 38,100; commune, 48,493. The cathedral (1272-1385)
is a fine Gothic building dating from the period of Pisan
supremacy; the other churches, and indeed all the principal
buildings of the town, are constructed of the local marble, to
which the place owes its importance. The Accademia di Belle
Arti contains several Roman antiquities found in the quarries,
and some modern works by local sculptors. A large theatre
was inaugurated in 1892. Some of the quarries were worked in
Roman times (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Luna</a></span>), but were abandoned after the downfall
of the western empire, until the growth of Pisan architecture
and sculpture in the 12th and 13th centuries created a demand
for it. The quarries now extend over almost the whole of the
Apuan Alps, and some 600 of them are being worked, of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page401" id="page401"></a>401</span>
345, with 4400 workmen, are at Carrara itself, and 50 (700 men)

<p><span class="bold">CARREL, JEAN BAPTISTE NICOLAS ARMAND<a name="ar48" id="ar48"></a></span> (1800-1836),
French publicist, was born at Rouen on the 8th of May 1800.
His father was a merchant in good circumstances, and he received
a liberal education at the college of Rouen, afterwards attending
the military school at St Cyr. He had an intense admiration for
the great generals of Napoleon, and his uncompromising spirit,
bold uprightness and independent views marked him as a man
to be suspected. Entering the army as sub-lieutenant he took
a secret but active part in the unsuccessful conspiracy of Belfort.
On the outbreak of war with Spain in 1823, Carrel, whose
sympathies were altogether with the liberal cause, sent in his resignation,
and succeeded in effecting his escape to Barcelona. He
enrolled himself in the foreign legion and fought gallantly against
his former comrades. Near Figuières the legion was compelled
to surrender, and Carrel became the prisoner of his old general,
Damas. There was considerable difficulty about the terms
of capitulation, and one council of war condemned Carrel to
death. Fortunately some informality prevented the sentence
being executed, and he was soon afterwards acquitted and set at
liberty. His career as a soldier being then finally closed, Carrel
resolved to devote himself to literature. He came to Paris
and began as secretary to Augustin Thierry, the historian. His
services were found to be of great value, and he not only obtained
admirable training in habits of composition, but was led to investigate
for himself some of the most interesting portions of
English history. His first work of importance (he had already
written one or two historical abstracts) was the <i>History of the
Counter-Revolution in England</i>, an exceedingly able political
study of the events which culminated in the Revolution of 1688.
He gradually became known as a skilful writer in various periodicals;
but it was not till he formed his connexion with the
<i>National</i> that he became a power in France. The <i>National</i>
was at first conducted by Thiers, Mignet and Carrel in conjunction;
but after the revolution of July, Thiers and Mignet
assumed office, and the whole management fell into the hands of
Carrel. Under his direction this journal became the first political
organ in Paris. His judgment was unusually clear, his principles
solid and well founded, his sincerity and honesty beyond question;
and to these qualities he united an admirable style, lucid, precise
and well balanced. As the defender of democracy he had frequently
to face serious dangers. He was once in Ste Pelagie,
and several times before the tribunal to answer for his journal.
Nor was he in less danger from private enmities. Before his
last fatal encounter he was twice engaged in duels with editors
of rival papers. The dispute which led to the duel with Émile
de Girardin was one of small moment, and might have been
amicably arranged had it not been for some slight obstinacy on
Carrel&rsquo;s part. The meeting took place on the morning of the
22nd of July 1836. De Girardin was wounded in the thigh,
Carrel in the groin. The wound was at once seen to be dangerous,
and Carrel was conveyed to the house of a friend, where he died
after two days&rsquo; suffering.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His works, with biographical notice by Littré, were published in
five volumes (Paris, 1858), A fine estimate of his character will be

<p><span class="bold">CARRERA, JOSÉ MIGUEL<a name="ar49" id="ar49"></a></span> (1785-1821), the principal leader
in the early fighting for the independence of Chile, was born at
Santiago on the 15th of October 1785. Sent to Spain for a
military career, he served in the Spanish army in the Napoleonic
war, but returned to Chile in July 1811, where his vigorous
character and military experience enabled him by means of a
series of coup d&rsquo;etats to place himself at the head of the nationalist
government. Though at first he laboured patriotically to establish
a stable administration, to promote education, and to
organize the Chilean forces, his selfish arrogant spirit produced
dissensions between himself and other patriots, and it was his
rivalry with Bernardo O&rsquo;Higgins that led to the defeat of the
nationalist forces at Rancagua in 1814. In the expedition of
1817, led by José de San Martin and Bernardo O&rsquo;Higgins, which
resulted in the liberation of Chile, Carrera had no share, owing
to his hostility to the leaders, but he attempted to procure in
the United States materials for a fresh enterprise of his own.
The Argentine government, however, suspicious of his intentions,
would not allow him to go to Chile, and Carrera, enraged by this
treatment and by the execution of his brothers at Mendoza by
the San Martin party, proceeded to organize rebellion in Argentina,
but was eventually captured and shot at Mendoza on the 4th of
September 1821.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARRIAGE,<a name="ar50" id="ar50"></a></span> a term which in its widest signification is used,
as its derivation permits, for any form of &ldquo;carrying&rdquo;; thus,
a person&rsquo;s &ldquo;carriage&rdquo; is still spoken of in the sense of the way
he bears himself. But it is more specifically the general term
for all vehicular structures employed for the purposes of transport
of merchandise and movable goods and of human beings.
Such vehicles are generally mounted on wheels, but the sledge
and the litter are types of the exception to this rule. Within this
definition a vast variety of forms is included, ranging from the
coster&rsquo;s barrow and rude farm-cart up to the luxuriously appointed
sleeping-cars of railways and the state carriages of royal
personages. A narrower application, however, limits the term
to such vehicles as are used for the conveyance of persons
and are drawn by horses, and it is with carriages in this restricted
sense that we are here concerned. Tramcars, railway carriages
and motor-cars are dealt with in other articles.</p>

<p><i>History</i>.&mdash;A wheeled carriage appears to have been in very
general use in Egypt at an early period, called a car or chariot
(<i>q.v.</i>); in the Bible the word is usually translated &ldquo;chariot.&rdquo;
The bodies of these chariots were small, usually containing only
two persons standing upright. They were very light, and
could be driven at great speed. They were narrow, and therefore
suitable to Eastern cities, in which the streets were very narrow,
and to mountainous roads, which were often only 4 ft. wide.
From Egypt the use of chariots spread into other countries, and
they were used in war in large numbers on the great plains of
Asia. We read of the 900 chariots of Jabin, king of Canaan;
how David took 700 chariots from the kings of Syria and 1000
from the king of Zobah. Solomon had 1400 chariots, and his
merchants supplied northern Syria and the surrounding countries
with chariots brought out of Egypt at 600 shekels (about £50)
apiece. From the ancient sculptures preserved from Nineveh
and Babylon, some of which are in the British Museum, we
observe the use of chariots continued for the purpose of hunting
as well as for war. Homer describes the chief warriors on both
sides at the siege of Troy as going into battle and fighting from
their chariots. The Roman nation as it increased in power
adopted the car, though chiefly for purposes of show and state.
A beautiful marble model of one of these still exists at the Vatican
in Rome: a copy of it and the horses drawing it is in the museum
at South Kensington. The war chariots used by the Persians
were larger; the idea seems to have been to form a sort of turret
upon the car, from which several warriors might shoot or throw
their spears. These chariots were provided with curved blades
projecting from the axle-trees. Alexander the Great, king of
Macedon, invading Asia was met upon the banks of the river
Indus by King Porus, in whose army were a number of elephants
and also several thousand chariots. On Alexander&rsquo;s return from
India towards Persia, he travelled in a chariot drawn by eight
horses, followed by an innumerable number of others covered
with rich carpets and purple coverlets. After Alexander&rsquo;s
death a funeral car was prepared to convey his body from Babylon
to Alexandria in Egypt, and this car has perhaps never been
excelled in the annals of coach-building. It was designed by the
celebrated architect Hieronymus, and took two years to build.
It was 18 ft. long and 12 ft. wide, on four massive wheels, and
drawn by sixty-four mules, eight abreast. The car was composed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page402" id="page402"></a>402</span>
of a platform, with a lofty roof, supported by eighteen columns,
and was profusely adorned with drapery, gold and jewels; round
the edge of the roof was a row of golden bells; in the centre was
a throne, and before it the coffin; around were placed the
weapons of war and the armour that Alexander had used.</p>

<p>The Romans established the use of carriages as a private
means of conveyance, and with them carriages attained great
variety of form as well as richness of ornamentation. In all
times the employment of carriages depended greatly on the
condition of the roads over which they had to be driven, and the
establishment of good roads, such as the Appian Way, constructed
331 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, and others, greatly facilitated the development of
carriage travelling among the Romans. In Rome itself, and
probably also in other large towns, it was necessary to restrict
travelling in carriages to a few persons of high rank, owing to
the narrowness and crowded state of the streets. For the same
reason the transport of goods along the streets was forbidden
between sunrise and sunset. For long journeys and to convey large
parties the <i>reda</i> and <i>carruca</i> appear to have been mostly used,
but what their construction and arrangements were is not known.
During the empire the carriage which appears in representations
of public ceremonials is the <i>carpentum</i>. It is very slight, with
two wheels, sometimes covered, and generally drawn by two
horses. If a carriage had four horses they were yoked abreast,
among the Greeks and Romans, not in two pairs as now. From
the <i>carruca</i> are traced the modern European names,&mdash;the English
<i>carriage</i>, the French <i>carrosse</i> and the Italian <i>carrozza</i>. The
<i>sirpea</i> was a very ancient form of vehicle, the body of which was
of osier basket-work. It originated with the Gauls, by whom
it was named <i>lenna</i>, and by them it was employed for the conveyance
of persons and goods in time of peace, and baggage
during war. With its name are connected the modern French
<i>banne, banneton, vannerie</i> and <i>panier</i>,&mdash;all indicating basket-work.</p>

<p>The ancient Britons used a car for warlike purposes which was
evidently new to the Romans. It was open in front, instead of at
the back as in their cars; and the pole, which went straight
out between the horses, was broad, so that the driver could
walk along, and if needful drive from the end. Above all, it
possessed a seat, and was called <i>essedum</i> from this peculiarity.
For war purposes this car was provided with scythes projecting
from the ends of the axle-trees. Cicero, writing to a friend in
Britain, remarks &ldquo;that there appeared to be very little worth
bringing away from Britain except the chariots, of which he
wished his friend to bring him one as a pattern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Roman vehicles were sometimes very splendidly ornamented
with gold and precious stones; and covered carriages
seem more and more to have become appendages of Roman
pomp and magnificence. Sumptuary laws were enacted on
account of the public extravagance, but they were little regarded,
and were altogether abrogated by the emperor Alexander Severus.
Suetonius states that Nero took with him on his travels no less
than a thousand carriages.</p>

<p>On the introduction of the feudal system the use of carriages
was for some time prohibited, as tending to render the vassals
less fit for military service. Men of all grades and professions
rode on horses or mules, and sometimes the monks and women
on she-asses. Horseback was the general mode of travelling;
and hence the members of the council, who at the diet and on
other occasions were employed as ambassadors, were called
<i>Rittmeister</i>. In this manner also great lords made their public
entry into cities.</p>

<p>Covered carriages (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Coach</a></span>) were known in the beginning
of the 15th century, but their use was confined to ladies of the
first rank; and as it was accounted a reproach for men to ride
in them, the electors and princes sometimes excused their non-attendance
at meetings of the state by the plea that their health
would not permit them to ride on horseback. Covered carriages
were for a long time forbidden even to women; but about the
end of the 15th century they began to be employed by the
emperor, kings and princes in journeys, and afterwards on state
occasions. In 1474 the emperor Frederick III. visited Frankfort
in a close carriage, and again in the following year in a very
magnificent covered carriage. Shortly afterwards carriages
began to be splendidly decorated; that, for instance, of the
electress of Brandenburg at the tournament held at Ruppin
in 1509 was gilded all over, and that of the duchess of Mecklenburg
was hung with red satin. When Cardinal Dietrichstein
made his entrance into Vienna in 1611, forty carriages went to
meet him; and in the same year the consort of the emperor
Matthias made her public entrance on her marriage in a carriage
covered with perfumed leather. The wedding carriage of the
first wife of the emperor Leopold, who was a Spanish princess,
cost, together with the harness, 38,000 florins. Those of the
emperor are thus described: &ldquo;In the imperial coaches no great
magnificence was to be seen; they were covered over with red
cloth and black nails. The harness was black, and in the whole
work there was no gold. The panels were of glass, and on this
account they were called the imperial glass coaches. On festivals
the harness was ornamented with red silk fringes. The imperial
coaches were distinguished only by their having leather traces;
but the ladies in the imperial suite were obliged to be contented
with carriages the traces of which were made of ropes.&rdquo; At the
magnificent court of Duke Ernest Augustus at Hanover, in 1681,
there were fifty gilt coaches with six horses each. The first time
that ambassadors appeared in coaches on a public solemnity
was at the imperial commission held at Erfurt in 1613. Soon
after this time coaches became common all over Germany, notwithstanding
various orders and admonitions to deter vassals
from using them. These vehicles appear to have been of very
rude construction. Beckmann describes a view he had seen of
Bremen, painted by John Landwehr in 1661, in which was
represented a long quadrangular carriage, apparently not
suspended by straps, and covered with a canopy supported by
four pillars, but without curtains. In the side was a small door,
and in front a low seat or box; the coachman sat upon the
horses; and the dress of the persons within proved them to be
burgomasters. At Paris in the 14th, 15th and even 16th centuries,
the French monarchs rode commonly on horses, the
servants of the court on mules, and the princesses and principal
ladies sometimes on asses. Persons even of the highest rank
sometimes sat behind their equerry on the same horse. Carriages,
however, were used at a very early period in France; for
there is still extant an ordinance of Philip the Fair, issued in
1294, by which citizens&rsquo; wives are prohibited from using them.
It appears, however, that about 1550 there were only three
carriages at Paris,&mdash;one belonging to the queen, another to
Diana of Poitiers, and the third to René de Laval, a very corpulent
nobleman who was unable to ride on horseback. The
coaches used in the time of Henry IV. were not suspended by
straps (an improvement referred to the time of Louis XIV.),
though they were provided with a canopy supported by four
ornamental pillars, and with curtains of stuff or leather.</p>

<p>Occasional allusion is made to the use of some kinds of vehicles
in England during the middle ages. In <i>The Squyr of Low Degree</i>,
a poem of a period anterior to Chaucer, a description of a sumptuous
carriage occurs:</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow ye shall on hunting fare</p>
<p class="i05">And ride, my daughter, in a chare.</p>
<p class="i05">It shall be cover&rsquo;d with velvet red,</p>
<p class="i05">And cloth of fine gold all about your head,</p>
<p class="i05">With damask white and azure blue</p>
<p class="i05">Well diaper&rsquo;d with lilies new.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">Chaucer himself describes a chare as</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;With gold wrought and pierrie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Richard II. of England, towards the end of the 14th
century, was obliged to fly before his rebellious subjects, he and
all his followers were on horseback, while his mother alone used
a carriage. The oldest carriages used in England were known
as chares, cars, chariots, caroches and whirlicotes; but these
became less fashionable when Ann, the wife of Riehard II.,
showed the English ladies how gracefully she could ride on the
side-saddle, Stow, in his <i>Survey of London</i>, remarking, &ldquo;so was
riding in those whirlicotes and chariots forsaken except at
coronations and such like spectacles.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page403" id="page403"></a>403</span></p>

<p>There were curious sumptuary laws enacted during the 16th
century in various Italian cities against the excessive use of silk,
velvet, embroidery and gilding, on the coverings of coaches
and the trappings of horses. In 1564 Pope Pius IV. exhorted
the cardinals and bishops not to ride in coaches, according to the
fashion of the times, but to leave such things to women, and
themselves ride on horseback. The use of coaches in Germany
in the 16th century was not less common than in Italy. The
current of trade, especially from the East, had for a long time
poured into those two countries towards Holland, enriching all
the cities in its progress. Macpherson, in his <i>History of Commerce</i>,
says that Antwerp possessed 500 coaches in 1560. France and
England appear to have been behind the rest of Europe at
this period.</p>

<p>The first coach in England was made in 1555 for the earl of
Rutland by Walter Rippon, who also made a coach in 1556 for
Queen Mary, and in 1564 a state coach for Queen Elizabeth.
That one of the carriages used by Queen Elizabeth could be
opened and closed at pleasure may be inferred from her causing
at Warwick during one of her progresses&mdash;&ldquo;every part and side
of her coach to be opened that all her subjects present might
behold her, which most gladly they desired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coaches of the type now properly so-called were first known in
England about the year 1580, and were introduced, according
to Stow, from Germany by Henry Fitzalan, 12th earl of Arundel.
By the beginning of the 17th century the use of coaches had
become so prevalent in England that in 1601 the attention of
parliament was drawn to the subject, and a bill &ldquo;to restrain
the excessive use of coaches&rdquo; was introduced, which, however,
was rejected on the second reading. Their use told severely on
the occupation of the Thames watermen, and Taylor the poet
and waterman complained bitterly both in prose and verse
against the new-fangled practice:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Carroaches, coaches, jades, and Flanders mares</p>
<p class="i05">Doe rob us of our shares, our wares, our fares.</p>
<p class="i05">Against the ground we stand and knock our heels</p>
<p class="i05">Whilest all our profit runs away on wheeles.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>The sneers of wits and watermen notwithstanding, coaches
became so common, that in the early part of the 17th century
they were estimated to number more than 6000 in London and
its surrounding country.</p>

<p>We now arrive gradually at the modern conception of carriage-building.
No trace of glass windows or complete doors for
coaches seems to have existed up to 1650. But plain and rude as
was the first coach of Louis XIV., it was in his reign, which lasted
till 1715, that the most rapid progress was made. The credit for
this is equally due to Germany, Italy, France and England.
There is very little mention made by historians of steel springs,
but they were first applied to wheel carriages about 1670, prior to
which bodies were suspended by long straps from the four
corners to pillars erected upon the under carriage. The great
advantage of the introduction of springs was speedily recognized
as reducing vibration, enabling carriages to be built much
lighter and lessening the draught for the horses. In the diary of
Samuel Pepys there are many amusing and interesting references
to the art of coach-building, which was beginning to attract
much attention at that period.</p>

<p>In the French <i>Encyclopédie</i> (1772) by Diderot there are
elaborate descriptions of the art of coach-building, the workshops
and tools used, and plates of the different carriages in use. The
18th century is remarkable for the rapid development which
took place, more especially in the manufacture of state carriages
of a sumptuous and ornate character, which were largely in
demand by the various courts of Europe. One of the most
beautiful of these is that belonging to the imperial family of
Vienna, which was built in 1696, and is shaped with all the curves
that are familiar to us in cabinets and furniture of the style of
Louis XIV. The panels are beautifully painted with nymphs in
the style of Rubens. There is an unusual quantity of plate glass
in the panels, and on the centre of the roof is a large imperial
crown. In 1757 was built the elaborate state coach of the city
of London, and in 1761 the royal state coach of England, built for
King George III. (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Coach</a></span>). During the reigns of George II.
and George III. all English manufactures had received an
immense impulse from the energy of the men of the time, in
which they were much encouraged by the action of the Society of
Arts in offering money prizes for improvements; and in these
coach-builders largely participated.</p>

<p>In the year 1804 Obadiah Elliot patented his plan for hanging
vehicles upon elliptical springs, thus dispensing with the heavy
wood and iron perch and cross beds, invariably used in four-wheeled
carriages up to that time. Elliot was rewarded by the
grant of a gold medal by the Society of Arts, and extensive
orders for the carriages of a lighter character, which he was thus
enabled to produce.</p>

<p>Of carriages much in fashion and characteristic of this period
may be mentioned the &ldquo;curricle,&rdquo; a cabriolet (see below) on two
wheels, driven with a pair of horses, the balance being secured
by an ornamental bar across the horses&rsquo; backs, connected by a
leather brace to a spring under the pole. For lack of perfect
safety this was gradually superseded by the &ldquo;gentleman&rsquo;s
cabriolet,&rdquo; for one horse, on C springs, fitted with folding leather
hood and platform behind, on which stood a youthful trim
servant in top-boots, popularly termed a &ldquo;tiger.&rdquo; To produce
this satisfactorily, the best coach-building talent was required,
and to work it a horse of exceptional strength and breeding was
needful, but when complete this equipage had a distinction
never surpassed. During this period the pair-horse &ldquo;mail
phaeton&rdquo; was introduced, and has enjoyed a long period of
popularity. As a travelling carriage with the needful appointments
the &ldquo;britzska,&rdquo; having a straight body with ogee curves
at front and back, with single folding hood, and hung on C springs,
was a distinctive and popular feature among carriages of the
period from 1824 until after 1840. Of two-wheeled vehicles the
&ldquo;stanhope&rdquo; and &ldquo;tilbury&rdquo; gigs, the &ldquo;dog cart&rdquo; and &ldquo;tandem
cart,&rdquo; came into use during these years, and have afforded
facilities of agreeable locomotion to many thousands of people at
a moderate cost. But the greatest improvement of this period
was the introduction of the &ldquo;brougham.&rdquo; Several attempts
had been made to arrive at a light carriage of this description, but
it was not until 1839 that a carriage was produced to a design
adopted by Lord Brougham, and called after him. The &ldquo;victoria&rdquo;
was known as a carriage for public hire in continental
cities for several years before being adopted as a fashionable
carriage by the wealthy classes. In 1869 the prince of Wales
brought one from Paris of the cab shape, and Baron Rothschild
brought one from Vienna of the square shape, examples speedily
followed. In various elegant and artistic forms, either as an
elliptic or C spring, it has since become a most popular and
convenient carriage.</p>

<p>Public carriages for hire, or hackney (<i>q.v.</i>) coaches, were first
established in London in 1625. In 1635 the number was restricted
to fifty. Still they increased, notwithstanding the opposition
of the court and king, who thought they would break up
the roads, till in 1650 there were as many as 300. In Paris
they were introduced during the minority of Louis XIV. by
Nicholas Sauvage, who lived in the rue St Martin at the sign
of St Fiacre, from which circumstance hackney carriages in
Paris have since been called <i>fiacres</i>. In 1694 the number in
London had increased to 700. Many of these were old private
coaches of the nobility and gentry, and it was not until 1790
that coaches on a smaller scale were built specially for hackney
purposes (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Coach</a></span>).</p>

<p>We are told that in 1673 there were stage coaches from London
to York, to Chester and to Exeter, having each forty horses on
the road, and carrying each six inside-passengers. The coach
occupied eight days travelling to Exeter. In 1706 a coach went
from London to York every Monday, Wednesday and Friday,
performing the journey in four days. In the same year there was
a coach from London to Birmingham starting on Monday and
arriving on Wednesday. In 1754 a coach was started from
Manchester called the flying coach, which was advertised to reach
London in four days and a half. In 1784 coaches became
universal at the speed of 8 m. an hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page404" id="page404"></a>404</span></p>

<p>In the year 1786 the prince of Wales, afterwards George IV.,
began to erect the pavilion at Brighton, and this led to a great
increase of traffic, so that in 1820 no less than 70 coaches
daily visited and left Brighton. The number continued to
increase, until in 1835 there were as many as 700 mail
coaches throughout Great Britain and Ireland. The system of
road construction introduced by Mr McAdam during this time
was of great value in facilitating this development.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the competition of the sedan-chair (<i>q.v.</i>), the
hackney-coach held its place and grew in importance, till it was
supplanted about 1820 by the <i>cabriolet de place</i>, now shortened
into &ldquo;cab&rdquo; (<i>q.v.</i>), which had previously held a most important
place in Paris. In that city the cabriolet came into great public
favour about the middle of the 18th century, and in the year
1813 there were 1150 such vehicles plying in the Parisian streets.
The original cabriolet was a kind of hooded gig, inside which the
driver sat, besides whom there was only room left for a single
passenger. For hackney purposes Mr Boulnois introduced a
four-wheeled cab to carry two persons, which was followed by
one to carry four persons, introduced by Mr Harvey, the prototype
of the London &ldquo;four-wheeler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hansom patent safety cab (1834) owes its invention to J.A.
Hansom (<i>q.v.</i>), the architect of the Birmingham town-hall. This
has passed through many stages of improvement with which the
name of Forder of Wolverhampton is conspicuously associated.</p>

<p>The prototype of the modern &ldquo;omnibus&rdquo; first began plying in
the streets of Paris on the 18th of March 1662, going at fixed
hours, at a stated fare of five sous. Soldiers, lackeys, pages and
livery servants were forbidden to enter such conveyances,
which were announced to be <i>pour la plus grande commodité et
liberté des personnes de mérite</i>. In the time of Charles X. the
omnibus system in reality was established; for no exclusion of
any class or condition of person who tendered the proper fare was
permitted in the vehicles then put on various routes, and the fact
of the carriages being thus &ldquo;at the service of all&rdquo; gave rise to the
present name. The first London omnibus was started in July
1829 by the enterprising Mr Shillibeer. The first omnibuses
were drawn by three horses abreast and carried twenty-two
passengers, all inside. Though appearing unwieldy they were
light of draught and travelled speedily. They were, however,
too large for the convenience of street traffic, and were superseded
by others carrying twelve passengers inside. In 1849 an outside
seat along the centre of the roof was added. The London
General Omnibus Company was founded in 1856; since then
continual improvements in this system of public conveyance
have been introduced.</p>

<p><i>Modern Private Carriages</i>.&mdash;At the accession of Queen Victoria
the means of travelling by road and horse-power, in the case of
public coaches, had reached in England its utmost limits of speed
and convenience, and the travelling-carriages of the nobility
and the wealthy were equipped with the completest and most
elaborate contrivances to secure personal comfort and safety.
More particularly was this the case as regards continental tours,
which had become indispensable to all who had at their command
the means for this costly educational and pleasurable experience.
Concurrently with this development the style and character of
court equipages had also reached a consummate degree of
splendour and artistic excellence. Not only was this the case
in points of decoration, in which livery colour and heraldic
devices were effectively employed, but also in the beauty of
outline and skilful structural adaptation, in which respect
carriages of that period made greater demands upon the capacity
of the builder and the skill of the workman than do those of the
present day. For this attainment the art of coachmaking was
indebted to a very few leading men, whose genius has left its
impress upon the art, and is still jealously cherished by those
who in early life had experience of their achievements. The
early portion of Queen Victoria&rsquo;s reign was an age of much
emulation; the best-equipped carriages of that period, distinctive
of noble families and foreign embassies, with their
graceful outline and superb appointments, and harnessed to a
splendid breed of horses&mdash;all harmoniously blended, perfect in
symmetry and adaptation&mdash;gave to the London season, more
especially on drawing-room days, and at other times in Hyde
Park, an attractiveness unequalled in any other capital. After
the death of the prince consort, the pageantry of that period very
much declined and, except as an appendage of royalty, full-dress
carriages have since been comparatively few, though there
are hopes of a revival in this direction. Meanwhile, owing to
the rapid development of railways and the wide extension of
commerce, the demand for carriages greatly increased. The
larger types gave place to others of a lighter build and more
general utility, in which in some cases an infusion of American
ideas made its appearance. In accordance with the universal
rule of supply meeting the demand, Mr Stenson, an ironmaster
of Northampton, was successful in producing a mild forging
steel, which proved for some years, until the manufacture ceased,
very conducive to the object of securing lightness with strength.
In the early &rsquo;seventies the eminent mechanician, Sir Joseph
Whitworth, in the course of his scientific studies in the perfecting
of artillery, succeeded in manufacturing a steel of great purity,
perfectly homogeneous and possessing marvellous tenacity and
strength, known as &ldquo;fluid compressed steel.&rdquo; Incidentally
carriage-building was able to participate in the results of this
discovery. Two firms well known to Sir Joseph were asked
to test its merits as a material applicable to this industry. In
this test much difficulty was experienced, the nature of the steel
not being favourable to welding, of which so much is required
in the making of coach ironwork; but after much perseverance
by skilful hands this was at length accomplished, and for some
years there existed not a little rivalry in the use of this material,
more especially in the case of carriages on the C and under-spring
principle, which for lightness, elegance and luxurious
riding left nothing to be desired. Many of these carriages may
be referred to to-day as rare examples of constructive skill.
Unfortunately, the original cost of the material, still more of the
labour to be expended upon it, and the difficulty of educating
men into the art of working it, were effectual barriers to its
general adoption. The idea, however, had taken hold, and
attention was given by other firms to the manufacture of the
steel now in general use, admitting of easier application, with
approximate, if not equal, results.</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:464px; height:193px" src="images/img404.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 1.</td></tr></table>

<p>From C and under-spring carriages there arose another
application of springs which was very prominently before the
public during this period, by means of which it was professed
that two drawbacks recognized in the C and under-spring
carriages were obviated, which were caused by the perch or bar
which passes under the body holding the front and hind parts
in rigid connexion, and yet making use of a form of spring to
which the same terms may be applied. These objections are
the weight of the perch, and the limitation which it causes to
the facility of turning, which in narrow roads and crowded
thoroughfares is an inconvenience. The objection to weight is,
however, minimized by the introduction of steel, and as the more
advanced builders almost always construct the perch with a
<i>forked</i> arch in front, allowing the wheels to pass under, the
difficulty of a limited lock is in a great measure overcome (fig. 1).
It must be noted, however (and this cannot be too emphatically
stated), that the so-called C springs above referred to are not at
all the same in action as the C spring proper; they are but an
elongation of the ordinary elliptic spring in the form of the
letter C (fig. 2), without adding anything to, but rather lessening
their elasticity, and entirely ignoring the principle of <i>suspension</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page405" id="page405"></a>405</span>
by leather braces over the C spring proper, by which alone the
advantage of superior ease is to be obtained.</p>

<p>Another improvement which stamps the period under review
is the introduction of indiarubber for the tires of wheels. To
produce a carriage as nearly as possible free from noise and
rattle has always been the aim of high-class coachmaking.
A structure composed of wood, iron and glass, with axle-trees,
doors, windows, lamps and other parts, in use upon the road
in all weathers, must from time to time require some attention
with this object. To meet this difficulty, the introduction of
indiarubber has been received by carriage-users as a great boon.
It was about the year 1852 that Mr Reading, who at that time
was known as a builder of invalid carriages, conceived the idea
of encircling wheels with that material, but his method only
admitted of its use on vehicles travelling slowly over good roads.
This was improved upon at a later date by Uriah Scott, who,
taking advantage of the tempering capacity of indiarubber by
the chemical action of sulphur, produced an inner rim of such
density as to hold bolts, by which it could be secured through the
felloe, forming a base for the outer covering of soft pliable rubber.
This system was attended with satisfactory results, and was in
favour for some years with persons whose health needed such
provision. Another method, originated by Mr Mulliner of Liverpool
in the early &rsquo;seventies, was to screw on iron flanges to the
outer and inner sides of the felloes, having a kind of lip to press
into the indiarubber filling the intervening space; but the cost
of this&mdash;£36 per set&mdash;rendered its adoption prohibitive. Meanwhile
another invention by Uriah Scott, afterwards improved
upon by an American patentee, came into use; this was known
as the &ldquo;rubber-cushioned axle,&rdquo; cylindrical rings being introduced
between the axle-box and hub of the wheel, thus insulating the
body of the carriage from the concussion of the road. This,
however, necessitated the cutting away of so much of the timber
of the hub as to impair its durability, and had, therefore, after a
few years&rsquo; experience, to be abandoned in favour of an invention
by a Parisian builder, who introduced indiarubber bearings
between the spring and axle-tree. This was thoroughly practicable,
and met with general acceptance, and it is still used in
conjunction with iron and steel tires. In 1890 the pneumatic
tire was first applied to road carriages. Its bulky appearance
is a great drawback, contrasting strongly with the qualities
which distinguish a graceful equipage; and in spite of its
practical advantages it never became popular in England or
America. In Paris and its neighbourhood and many parts of
France, pneumatic tires are to be seen in frequent use both on
public and private conveyances. In another form the indiarubber
tire has become of almost universal application.
Owing to an ingenious invention of
Mr Carment, what appeared to be an insuperable
difficulty in rolling a grooved tire
was overcome (fig. 3). This so simplified
the application as to bring the cost within
practicable limits. The grooved tire is now
made in several sections, in some of which the inward projection
for securing the rubber is dispensed with, this being kept in position
by wires running through the whole length, and electrically
welded at the point of contact. Whatever be the method chosen
for securing the tire, the best tires, both for durability and ease,
are those in which the rubber provided is most resilient in its
nature.</p>

<p>For the lifting and lowering of the hoods of victorias and other
such carriages, and the opening and closing of landaus, there
are now many automatic contrivances, of which the simplest
are the most to be preferred. The quarter-light or five-glass
landau is a carriage which has been greatly improved. The
complicated adjustments of pillars, windows and roof have been
replaced by one simple parallel movement. The first public
exhibition of a finished carriage on this principle was by an
English firm at the Paris Exhibition of 1876 (fig. 4).</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:364px; height:201px" src="images/img405c.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 4.</td></tr></table>

<p>In the matter of style certain types of carriages have passed
through marked changes. Extreme lightness was at one time
considered by many the one desideratum both as to appearance
and actual weight, in providing which ease of movement and
comfortable seating of the occupants became secondary
considerations&mdash;though to these extremes builders of repute were
always opposed. Still, when at the International Exhibition of
Paris 1889, it was seen that the Parisian builders had suddenly
gone in the opposite direction, the world of fashion in carriages
was taken by surprise. From being built upon easy, flowing,
graceful lines, it was seen, with some revulsion of feeling, that
these were to be displaced by the deep, full-bodied victoria,
brougham and landau. Only by slow degrees did this characteristic
find acceptance with English connoisseurs, and then only
in a modified form, though eventually in a greater or less degree
it is now the prevailing style.</p>

<p>While the better types of English carriages are still preeminent
in their constructive qualities, and represent the
well-known characteristics of individual firms, some emulation
may be excited by the elegant taste and careful workmanship
which French builders display in points of finish, both internally
and externally. Of the various types of carriages now in vogue,
the victoria, in its many varieties of form, is the most popular,
accompanied, as of necessity, by the double victoria, sociable,
brougham, landaulet and landau. Four-in-hand coaches for
private use, as well as the &ldquo;road&rdquo; coaches, are built on a smaller
scale than formerly; 6 ft. 8 in. may now be taken as the standard
height of the roof from the ground. Owing to the encouragement
given by the Four-in-hand and Coaching Clubs, the ascendancy
of this style of driving is still preserved to Great Britain; and
in association with it the char-à-banc, mail phaeton, wagonette,
and four-wheel dog-cart retain their popularity. Of two-wheeled
vehicles the polo-cart and ralli-cart are most in favour,
to which may be added the governess-car, which is found
convenient for many purposes not implied by its name. For a few
years an effort was made, but with very indifferent success, to
bring into fashion the tandem-cart, which may again be considered
almost obsolete in England.</p>

<p>America has long held a prominent position in connexion with
the carriage industry. In all the chief cities manufactories on a
colossal scale are to be found, producing thousands of vehicles
annually and equipped with the most perfect labour-saving
machinery; and as vehicles of any particular pattern&mdash;many of
small value&mdash;are required, not singly, but in large numbers, much
economy is exercised in their manufacture. It is remarkable that,
as a contrast to the popular buggy, wagon and rockaway of the
United States, which are to be found in infinite variety, carriage
establishments of the wealthy are not considered complete unless
furnished with some of a European character, selected from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page406" id="page406"></a>406</span>
most eminent firms of London or Paris, in addition to others of
their own manufacture. In Paris preference is given to an
excess of bulk, with elaborate scroll ornamentation and diminutive
windows, forming indeed, by reason of its exaggeration, a
distinctive class. In respect of workmanship and finish,
carriages by the best-known American builders leave nothing to
be desired.</p>

<p>The International Exhibition of Paris 1900 brought together
examples from various continental countries, in some of which a
preference for curvilinear outline was displayed, but the best
examples followed very closely the well-known English styles.
In the French section it was interesting to find a revival of the
once all-prevailing chariot, barouche and britzska, suspended on
C and under-springs, with perch, but with ideas of lightness
somewhat out of proportion to their general character.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Coach-making</i>, or the carriage-manufacturing industry, is a
combination of crafts rarely united in one trade, embracing as it does
work in such divers materials as wood, iron, steel, brass, cloth,
silk, leather, oils and colours, glass, ivory, hair, indiarubber, &amp;c.
Many divisions of labour and numerous highly-skilled artisans are
consequently employed in the various stages in the construction of
a high-class carriage. The workmen include body-makers, who
build up the parts in which persons sit; carriage-makers, who make
and fit together all the under parts of the vehicle on which the body
rests; wheelwrights, joiners and fitters; several classes of smiths,
for special work connected with the strengthening of the body framework
by means of long edge plates, the construction of under works,
tiring and wheels, manufacture of springs, axle-trees, &amp;c. Painting
is an important part of the business, those professing it being
divided into body, carriage and heraldry painters. Trimmers are
needed who fit up the upholstery of the interior, and budget
trimmers who sew on the patent leather covering to dasher
wings, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A very great deal in the coach-making industry depends upon the
selection of materials. Ash is the kind of wood required in the
framework both of body and carriage. The quality best suited for
the body is that of full-grown mild and free nature; for the carriage
that which is strong and robust; that for carriage-poles should be of
younger growth, straight and tough in quality. An important consideration
is the seasoning of this timber. Planks of various thicknesses
are required, varying from 1½ in. to 6 in., the time required
for seasoning being one year for every inch of thickness. After the
framework is made, the body is panelled with ¼ in. mild Honduras
mahogany, plain and free from grain, every joint and groove carefully
coated with ground white lead to exclude water. The roof is
covered with ¼ in. wide pine boards, unless when superseded by an
American invention, by which, in order to obtain the needful width
frequently of 5 ft. or upwards, boards are cut from the circumference
of the tree, instead of through its diameter; three thicknesses of
very thin wood are then glued together under pressure, the grain of
the centre running across the outer plies, the whole forming a solid
covering without joints. Birch and elm of 1 in. thickness also enter
into the construction in many carriages; for floor and lining boards
pine is the material used.</p>

<p>Wheel-making is a very important branch of the business, in
which, owing to the increased lightness now required, many modern
improvements have been introduced. The timber used in an
ordinary carriage wheel is wych elm for the naves, heart of oak for
the spokes, and ash for the felloes. American hickory has of late
years been also largely used for spokes in exceptionally light wheels,
as well as the American method of making the rim in two sections of
straight-grained ash or hickory bent to the required circle. This
method has much to recommend it, more especially for wheels with
indiarubber tires, in which the wood felloes are not required to be
nearly so deep as for steel tires. One well-known feature in light
wheels is the &ldquo;Warner nave,&rdquo; which is a solid iron casting with
mortices to receive the spokes, and being of small diameter gives the
wheel a light appearance.</p>

<p>For springs the finest quality of steel is made from Swedish ore,
but the ordinary English spring steel by the best makers leaves
nothing to be desired. To secure the most perfect elasticity it is
important that the tapering down of the ends of each plate should
be done by hand labour on the anvil, and that the plates should
not be more than ¼ in. in thickness. To obtain cheapness wholesale
spring-makers adopt the method of squeezing the ends of spring
plates between eccentric rollers, and so produce the tapered form,
which, however, is too short and gives a lumpy and unsightly appearance
to the spring when put together, so that by this they lose much
of their pliability.</p>

<p>The iron mounting of coach work requires the skill of experienced
smiths, and gives scope for much taste and judgment in shaping
the work, and providing strength suited to the relative strain to
which it will be subjected. Axle-trees are not made by coach-builders,
but by firms who make it their special business. They are
of two kinds, the &ldquo;mail,&rdquo; which are secured to the wheel by three
bolts passing through the nave, and the &ldquo;collinge&rdquo; (invented in
1792), the latter made secure by gun-metal cone-shaped collets and
nuts. The axle boxes which are wedged into the nave are of three
kinds, cast, chilled and wrought iron, in all cases case-hardened,
the first being the cheapest and the last the most costly. Many
attempts have been made to improve upon the collinge axle-tree,
but none of them has got far beyond the experimental stage.</p>

<p>No branch of coach-building contributes more to the elegance of
the vehicle than that of painting. To obtain the needful perfection
the work has to pass through several stages before reaching the
finishing colour, which must be of the finest quality. The varnish
used is copal, of which there are two kinds, the one for finishing the
body, the other the carriage. In first-class work as many as eighteen
or twenty coats will be required to complete the various stages.
After a carriage has been in use about twelve months, it is practicable
to revive the brilliant gloss on the panels by hand-polishing with
the aid of rottenstone and oil, a process which requires a specially
trained man to do successfully.</p>

<p>The trimming of the interior of a carriage requires much skill and
judgment on the part of the workmen in providing really comfortable,
well-fitted seats and neatness of workmanship. In the middle of the
19th century figured tabaret or satin were much used, but for many
years past morocco has been almost universally preferred. Silk
lutestring spring curtains, Brussels or velvet pile carpet, complete
the interior, unless are added neat morocco covered trays with
mirror, &amp;c., for ladies&rsquo; convenience. Electric light is now frequently
used for the interior, and can be applied with much neatness and
efficiency. Road lamps, door handles, polished silver or brass
furniture, are supplied to the coach-builder by firms whose special
business it is to make them. Lever brakes are now a very ordinary
requirement. Much judgment is needful to make them efficient,
and careful workmanship to prevent rattle. Indiarubber is the best
material for blocks applied to steel tires, and cast iron for indiarubber
tires. The &ldquo;Bowden wire&rdquo; recently introduced is in some cases a
convenient and light alternative to the long bar connecting the
handle with the hind cross levers, and has the advantage of passing
out of sight through the interior of the body.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARRICKFERGUS,<a name="ar51" id="ar51"></a></span> a seaport and watering-place of Co. Antrim,
Ireland, in the east parliamentary division; on the northern
shore of Belfast Lough, 9½ m. N.E. of Belfast by the Northern
Counties (Midland) railway. Pop. of urban district (1901) 4208.
It stretches for about 1 m. along the shore of the Lough. The
principal building is the castle, originally built by John de Courci
towards the close of the 12th century, and subsequently much
enlarged. It stands on a projecting rock above the sea, and was
formerly a place of much strength. It is still maintained as an
arsenal, and mounted with heavy guns. The ancient donjon or
keep, 90 ft. in height, is still in good preservation. The town
walls, built by Sir Henry Sidney, are still visible on the west and
north, and the North Gate remains. The parish church of St
Nicholas, an antiquated cruciform structure with curious
Elizabethan work in the north transept, and monuments of the
Chichester family, was originally a chapel or oratory dependent
on a Franciscan monastery. The entrance to a subterranean
passage between the two establishments is still visible under the
communion-table of the church. The gaol, built on the site of
the monastery above mentioned, was formerly the county of
Antrim prison. The court-house, which adjoins the gaol, is a
modern building. The town has some trade in domestic produce,
and in leather and linen manufactures, there being several flax
spinning-mills and bleach-works in the immediate neighbourhood.
Distilling is carried on. The harbour admits vessels of 500 tons.
The fisheries are valuable, especially the oyster fisheries. At
Duncrue about 2 m. from the town, rock salt of remarkable
purity and in large quantity is found in the Triassic sandstone.
The neighbouring country is generally hilly, and Slieve True
(1100 ft.) commands a magnificent prospect.</p>

<p>In 1182, John de Courci, to whom Henry II. had granted all
the parts of Ulster he could obtain possession of by the sword,
fixed a colony in this district. The castle came in the 13th
century into possession of the De Lacy family, who, being
ejected, invited Edward Bruce to besiege it (1315). After a
desperate resistance the garrison surrendered. In 1386, the
town was burned by the Scots, and in 1400 was destroyed by
the combined Scots and Irish. Subsequently, it suffered much
by famine and the occasional assaults of the neighbouring Irish
chieftains, whose favour the townsmen were at length forced
to secure by the payment of an annual tribute. In the reign of
Charles I. many Scottish Covenanters settled in the neighbourhood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page407" id="page407"></a>407</span>
to avoid the persecution directed against them. In the civil
wars, from 1641, Carrickfergus was one of the chief places of
refuge for the Protestants of the county of Antrim; and on
the 10th of June 1642, the first Presbytery held in Ireland met
here. In that year the garrison was commanded by General
Robert Munro, who, having afterwards relinquished the cause
of the English parliament, was surprised and taken prisoner by
Sir Robert Adair in 1648. At a later period Carrickfergus was
held by the partisans of James II., but surrendered in 1689 to
the forces under King William&rsquo;s general Schomberg; and in
1690 it was visited by King William, who landed here on his
expedition to Ireland. In 1760 it was surprised by a French
squadron under Commodore Thurot, who landed with about
1000 men, and, after holding the place for a few days, evacuated
it on the approach of the English troops. Eighteen years later
Paul Jones, in his ship the &ldquo;Ranger,&rdquo; succeeded in capturing
the &ldquo;Drake,&rdquo; a British sloop-of war, in the neighbouring bay;
but he left without molesting the town. In the reign of Queen
Elizabeth the town obtained a charter, and this was confirmed
by James I., who added the privilege of sending two burgesses
to the Irish parliament. The corporation, however, was superseded,
under the provisions of the Municipal Reform Act of 1840,
by a board of municipal commissioners. Carrickfergus was a
parliamentary borough until 1885; and a county of a town till
1898, having previously (till 1850) been the county town of
county Antrim. But its importance was sapped by the vicinity
of Belfast, and its historical associations are now its chief interest.</p>

in the south parliamentary division, 68 m. N.W. of Dublin on
a branch of the Great Northern railway. Pop. of urban district
(1901) 1874. It has a pleasant, elevated site, a considerable
agricultural trade, and a famous manufacture of lace, which is
carried on in various conventual establishments. There are
some remains of an Elizabethan castle, a seat of the earls of
Essex, which was destroyed during the wars of 1641; the ruins
of the old church of St Finbar commemorate the same disastrous
period.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARRICK-ON-SHANNON,<a name="ar53" id="ar53"></a></span> a market town and the county
town of Co. Leitrim, Ireland, in the south parliamentary division,
beautifully situated on the left bank of the upper Shannon,
between Loughs Allen and Boderg, close to the confluence of
the Boyle. Pop. (1901) 1118. It is on the Sligo branch of the
Midland Great Western railway, 90 m. W.N.W. of Dublin,
the station being across the river in county Roscommon. Though
having so small a population it is the largest town in the county,
is the seat of the assizes, and has quays and some river trade.

Limerick line of the Great Southern &amp; Western railway. Pop.
of urban district (1901) 5406. It was formerly a walled town,
and contains some ancient buildings, such as the castle, erected
in 1309, formerly a seat of the dukes of Ormonde, now belonging
to the Butler family, a branch of which takes the title of earl
from the town. On the other side of the river, connected by a
bridge of the 14th century, and another of modern erection, stands
the suburb of Carrickbeg, in county Waterford, where an abbey
was founded in 1336. The woollen manufactures for which the
town was formerly famous are extinct. A thriving export trade
is carried on in agricultural produce, condensed milk is manufactured,
and slate is extensively quarried in the neighbourhood,
while some coal is exported from the neighbouring fields.
Dredging has improved the navigable channel of the river, which
is tidal to this point and is lined with quays.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARRIER, JEAN BAPTISTE<a name="ar55" id="ar55"></a></span> (1756-1794), French Revolutionist
and Terrorist, was born at Yolet, a village near Aurillac
in Upper Auvergne. In 1790 he was a country attorney (counsellor
for the <i>bailliage</i> of Aurillac) and in 1792 he was chosen
deputy to the National Convention. He was already known
as one of the influential members of the Cordeliers club and of
that of the Jacobins. After the subjugation of Flanders he was
one of the commissioners nominated in the close of 1792 by the
Convention, and sent into that country. In the following year
he took part in establishing the Revolutionary Tribunal. He
voted for the death of Louis XVI., was one of the first to call for
the arrest of the duke of Orleans, and took a prominent part in
the overthrow of the Girondists (on the 31st of May). After a
mission into Normandy, Carrier was sent, early in October 1793,
to Nantes, under orders from the Convention to suppress the
revolt which was raging there, by the most severe measures.
Nothing loth, he established a revolutionary tribunal, and
formed a body of desperate men, called the Legion of Marat, for
the purpose of destroying in the swiftest way the masses of
prisoners heaped in the jails. The form of trial was soon discontinued,
and the victims were sent to the guillotine or shot or
cut down in the prisons <i>en masse</i>. He also had large numbers
of prisoners put on board vessels with trap doors for bottoms,
and sunk in the Loire. This atrocious process, known as the
<i>Noyades</i> of Nantes, gained for Carrier a reputation for wanton
cruelty. Since in his mission to Normandy he had been very
moderate, it is possible that, as he was nervous and ill when sent
to Nantes, his mind had become unbalanced by the atrocities
committed by the Vendean and royalist armies. Naturally, the
stories told of him are not all true. He was recalled by the
Committee of Public Safety on the 8th of February 1794, took
part in the attack on Robespierre on the 9th Thermidor, but was
himself brought before the Revolutionary Tribunal on the 11th
and guillotined on the 16th of November 1794.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CARRIER,<a name="ar56" id="ar56"></a></span> a general term for any person who conveys the
goods of another for hire, more specifically applied to the tradesmen,
now largely superseded by the railway system, who convey
goods in carts or wagons on the public roads. In jurisprudence,
however, the term is collectively applied to all conveyers of
property, whether by land or water; and in this sense the changes
and enlargements of the system of transit throughout the world
have given additional importance to the subject. The law by
which carriers, both by land and sea, are made responsible for
the goods entrusted to them, is founded on the praetorian edict
of the civil law, to which the ninth title of the fourth book of the
Pandect is devoted. The edict itself is contained in these few
words, &ldquo;<i>nautae, caupones, stabularii, quod cujusque salvum fore
receperint, nisi restituent, in eos judicium dabo.</i>&rdquo; The simplicity of
the rule so announced has had a most beneficial influence on the
commerce of the world. Throughout the great civilized region
which took its law directly from Rome, and through the other
less civilized countries which followed the same commercial code,
it laid a foundation for the principle that the carrier&rsquo;s engagement
to the public is a contract of indemnity. It bound him in the
general case, to deliver what he had been entrusted with, or
its value,&mdash;thus sweeping away all secondary questions or discussions
as to the conditions of mere or less culpability on his
part under which loss or damage may have occurred; and it
left any limitations of this general responsibility to be separately
adjusted by special contract.</p>

<p>The law of England recognizes a distinction between a common
and a private carrier. The former is one who holds himself out to
the public as ready to carry for hire from place to place the goods
of such persons as choose to employ him. The owner of a stagecoach,
a railway company, the master of a general ship, a wharfinger
carrying goods on his own lighters are common carriers;
and it makes no difference that one of the <i>termini</i> of the journey
is out of England. It has been held, however, that a person who
carries only passengers is not a common carrier; nor of course is
a person who merely engages to carry the goods of particular
individuals or to carry goods upon any particular occasion. A
common carrier is subject at law to peculiar liabilities. He is
bound to carry the goods of any person who offers to pay his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page408" id="page408"></a>408</span>
hire, unless there is a good reason to the contrary, as, for example,
when his carriage is full, or the article is not such as he is in the
habit of conveying. He ought to carry the goods in the usual
course without unnecessary deviation or delay. To make him
liable there must be a due delivery of the goods to him in the
known course of his business. His charge must be reasonable;
and he must not give undue preference to any customer or class
of customers. The latter principle, as enforced by statute, has
come to be of great importance in the law of railway companies.
In respect of goods entrusted to him, the carrier&rsquo;s liability, unless
limited by a special contract, is, as already stated, that of an
insurer. There is no question of negligence as in the case of
injury to passengers, for the warranty is simply to carry safely
and securely. The law, however, excepts losses or injuries
occasioned immediately &ldquo;by the act of God or the king&rsquo;s
enemies&rdquo;&mdash;words which have long had a strict technical signification.
It would appear that concealment without fraud, on the
part of the customer, will relieve the carrier from his liability for
<i>negligence</i>, but not for actual <i>misfeasance</i>. Fraud or deceit by
the customer (<i>e.g.</i>, in misrepresenting the real value of the goods)
will relieve the carrier from his liability. The responsibility of the
carrier ceases only with the delivery of the goods to the proper
consignee. By the Carriers&rsquo; Act 1830 the liability of carriers for
gold, silver, &amp;c. (in general &ldquo;articles of great value in small
compass&rdquo;) is determined. Should the article or parcel exceed
£10 in value, the carrier is not to be liable for loss unless such
value is declared by the customer and the carrier&rsquo;s increased
charge paid. Where the value is thus declared, the carrier may,
by public notice, demand an increased charge, for which he must,
if required, sign a receipt. Failing such receipt or notice, the
carrier must refund the increased charge and remain liable as at
common law. Except as above no mere notice or declaration
shall affect a carrier&rsquo;s liability; but he may make special contracts
with his customers. The carriage of goods by sea is
subject to special regulations (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Affreightment</a></span>). The
carriage of goods by railway and canal is subject to the law of
common carrier, except where varied by particular statutes, as
the Railway and Canal Traffic Acts 1854 to 1894 and the Regulation
of Railways Acts 1840 to 1893. The effect of these acts is to
prevent railway companies as common carriers from limiting by
special contract their liability to receive, forward and deliver
goods, unless the conditions embodied in the special contract are
reasonable, and the contract is in writing and signed by, or on
behalf of, the sender. A railway company must provide reasonable
facilities for forwarding passengers&rsquo; luggage; where luggage
is taken into the carriage with a passenger, the company is
responsible for it only in so far as loss or damage is due to the
passenger&rsquo;s interference with the company&rsquo;s exclusive control
of it. As carriers of passengers companies are bound, in the
absence of any special contract, to exercise due care and diligence,
and are responsible for personal injuries only when they have
been occasioned by negligence or want of skill. Where there has
been contributory negligence on the part of the passenger, <i>i.e.</i>
where he might, by the exercise of ordinary care, have avoided
the consequences of the defendants&rsquo; negligence&mdash;he is not
entitled to recover. By the act of 1846 (commonly called Lord
Campbell&rsquo;s Act), when a person&rsquo;s death has been caused by such
negligence as would have entitled him to an action had he
survived, an action may be maintained against the party responsible
for the negligence on behalf of the wife, husband,
parent or child of the deceased. Previously such cases had been
governed by the maxim <i>actio personalis moritur cum persona</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARRIÈRE, MORITZ<a name="ar57" id="ar57"></a></span> (1817-1895), German philosopher and
historian, was born at Griedel in Hesse Darmstadt on the 5th of
March 1817. After studying at Giessen, Göttingen and Berlin,
he spent a few years in Italy studying the fine arts, and established
himself in 1842 at Giessen as a teacher of philosophy. In 1853 he
was appointed professor at the university of Munich, where he
lectured mainly on aesthetics. He died in Munich on the 19th
of January 1895. An avowed enemy of Ultramontanism, he
contributed in no small degree to making the idea of German
unity more palatable to the South Germans. Carrière identified
himself with the school of the younger Fichte as one who held the
theistic view of the world which aimed at reconciling the contradictions
between deism and pantheism. Although no obstinate
adherent of antiquated forms and prejudices, he firmly upheld
the fundamental truths of Christianity. His most important
works are: <i>Aesthetik</i> (Leipzig, 1859; 3rd ed., 1885), supplemented
by <i>Die Kunst im Zusammenhang der Kulturentwicklung und der
Ideale der Menschheit</i> (3rd ed., 1877-1886); <i>Die philosophische
Weltanschauung der Reformationszeit</i> (Stuttgart, 1847; 2nd ed.,
Leipzig, 1886), and <i>Die sittliche Weltordnung</i> (Leipzig, 1877;
2nd ed., 1891), in which he recognized both the immutability of
the laws of nature and the freedom of the will. He described
his view of the world and life as &ldquo;real-idealism.&rdquo; His essay on
Cromwell (in <i>Lebensskizzen</i>, 1890), which may be considered his
political confession of faith, also deserves mention. His complete
works were published at Leipzig, 14 vols., in 1886-1894.</p>

1ST EARL (1843-&emsp;&emsp;), English statesman, son of the 2nd Baron
Carrington (d. 1868), was educated at Eton and Trinity,
Cambridge, and sat in the House of Commons as a Liberal for
High Wycombe from 1865 till he succeeded to the title in 1868.
He was governor of New South Wales 1885-1890, lord chamberlain
1892-1895, and became president of the board of agriculture
in 1905, having a seat in the cabinet in Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman&rsquo;s
and Mr Asquith&rsquo;s ministries. He was created Earl
Carrington and Viscount Wendover in 1895. The Carrington
barony was conferred in 1796 on Robert Smith (1752-1838),
M.P. for Nottingham, a member of a famous banking family,
the title being suggested by one held from 1643 to 1706 in another
family of Smith in no way connected. The 2nd baron married
as his second wife one of the two daughters of Lord Willoughby
de Eresby, and their son, through her, became in 1879 joint

English astronomer, son of a brewer at Brentford, was born in
London on the 26th of May 1826. Though intended for the
Church, his studies and tastes inclined him to astronomy, and
with a view to gaining experience in the routine of an observatory
he accepted the post of observer in the university of Durham.
Finding, however, that there was little chance of obtaining
instruments suitable for the work which he wished to undertake,
he resigned that appointment and established in 1853 an
observatory of his own at Redhill. Here he devoted three years
to a survey of the zone of the heavens within 9 degrees of the
North Pole, the results of which are contained in his <i>Redhill
Catalogue of 3735 Stars</i>. But his name is chiefly perpetuated
through his investigation of the motions of sun-spots, by which he
determined the elements of the sun&rsquo;s rotation and made the
important discovery of a systematic drift of the photosphere,
causing the rotation-periods of spots to lengthen with increase
of solar latitude. He died on the 27th of November 1875.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARROCCIO<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span>; a war chariot drawn by oxen, used by the
medieval republics of Italy. It was a rectangular platform on
which the standard of the city and an altar were erected; priests
held services on the altar before the battle, and the trumpeters
beside them encouraged the fighters to the fray. In battle the
carroccio was surrounded by the bravest warriors in the army and
it served both as a rallying-point and as the palladium of the city&rsquo;s
honour; its capture by the enemy was regarded as an irretrievable
defeat and humiliation. It was first employed by the
Milanese in 1038, and played a great part in the wars of the
Lombard league against the emperor Frederick Barbarossa. It
was afterwards adopted by other cities, and first appears on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page409" id="page409"></a>409</span>
Florentine battlefield in 1228. The Florentine carroccio was
usually followed by a smaller car bearing the <i>martinella</i>, a bell to
ring out military signals. When war was regarded as likely the
<i>martinella</i> was attached to the door of the church of Santa Maria
in the Mercato Nuovo in Florence and rung to warn both citizens
and enemies. In times of peace the carroccio was in the keeping
of some great family which had distinguished itself by signal
services to the republic.</p>

He made his first appearance as a violinist at the age of nine, and
had the advantage of studying between the ages of twelve and
eighteen at Stuttgart, with Wilhelm Bernhard Molique. On his
return to England in 1853 Costa got him engagements in the
leading orchestras. He was a member of the Covent Garden
opera orchestra from 1855, made his début as a solo player at a
concert given on the 22nd of April 1863 by the Musical Society
of London, and succeeded Sainton as leader at Covent Garden
in 1869. He died at Hampstead on the 13th of July 1895. For

<p><span class="bold">CARROLL, CHARLES<a name="ar62" id="ar62"></a></span> (1737-1832), American political leader,
of Irish ancestry, was born at Annapolis, Maryland, on the 19th
of September 1737. He was educated abroad in French Jesuit
colleges, studied law at Bourges, Paris and London, and in
February 1765 returned to Maryland, where an estate known as
&ldquo;Carrollton,&rdquo; in Frederick county, was settled upon him;
he always signed his name as &ldquo;Charles Carroll of Carrollton.&rdquo;
Before and during the War of Independence, he was a whig or
patriot leader, and as such was naturally a member of the various
local and provincial extra-legal bodies&mdash;committees of correspondence,
committees of observation, council of safety, provincial
convention (1774-1776) and constitutional convention (1776).
From 1777 until 1800 he was a member of the Maryland senate.
In April-June 1776 he, with Samuel Chase and Benjamin
Franklin, was a member of the commission fruitlessly sent by
the continental congress to Canada for the purpose of persuading
the Canadians to join the thirteen revolting colonies. From
1776 to 1779 he sat in the continental congress, rendering
important services as a member of the board of war, and signing
on the 2nd of August 1776 the Declaration of Independence,
though he had not been elected until the day on which that
document was adopted. He out-lived all of the other signers.
He was a member of the United States Senate from 1789 to 1792.
From 1801 until his death, at Baltimore, on the 14th of November
1832, he lived in retirement, his last public act being the formal
ceremony of starting the construction of the Baltimore and Ohio
railway (July 4, 1828). In politics, after the formation of
parties, he was a staunch Federalist. Of unusual ability,
high character and great wealth, he exercised a powerful
influence, particularly among his co-religionists of the Roman
Catholic faith, and he used it to secure the independence of the
colonies and to establish a stable central government.</p>

the son of Lord Stourton, he travelled through Europe in 1772-1773.
After the papal brief of the 21st of July 1773 suppressed
the Society of Jesus, he accompanied its English members then
in Flanders to England. In 1774 he returned to America, and
set to work at a mission at Rock Creek, Montgomery county,
Maryland, where his mother lived. He shared the feeling for
independence growing among the American colonists, foreseeing
that it would mean greater religious freedom. In 1776, at the
request of the continental congress, he accompanied Benjamin
Franklin, Charles Carroll and Samuel Chase on their mission
to secure the aid or neutrality of the French-Canadians, and
though unsuccessful it gained for him the friendship of Franklin.
In 1783 he took a prominent part in the petition to Rome to
take the control of the American church away from London; and
on Franklin&rsquo;s recommendation, Carroll was named prefect apostolic,
the American church being recognized as a distinct body in
a decree issued by Cardinal Antonelli on the 9th of June 1784. In
the summer of 1785 he began his visitations; in 1786 he induced
the general chapter to authorize a Catholic seminary (now
Georgetown University); and at the same session it was voted
that the condition of the church required a bishop, accountable
directly to the pope (and not to the Congregation of the Propaganda)
and chosen by the American clergy. Consent to this
course was given by Antonelli in a letter of the 12th of July
1788. The clergy met at Whitemarsh, Maryland, and Baltimore
was adopted as the episcopal seat, Carroll being chosen as
bishop; and on the 6th of November 1789 Pius VI. issued a bull
to that effect, Carroll being consecrated at Lulworth Castle,
England, on the 15th of August 1790.</p>

<p>On his return from England the bishop saw Georgetown
College completed (1791), thanks to moneys he had received
from English Catholics. His first synod met on the 7th of November
1791; and on the 16th he issued the &ldquo;Circular on Christian
Marriage,&rdquo; which attacked marriage by any save &ldquo;lawful
pastors of our church.&rdquo; In 1795 the Rev. Leonard Neale (1746-1817)
was appointed his coadjutor. In 1799, after the death
of Washington, Bishop Carroll bade his clergy hold the 22nd
of February 1800 as a day of mourning, and on that day delivered
in his pro-cathedral a memorial discourse which attracted
much attention. Already in 1802 he was pressing for the
creation of new sees in his diocese, and the Louisiana Purchase
of 1803 gave added weight to this request; in September 1805
the Propaganda made him administrator apostolic of the diocese
of New Orleans, to which he appointed John Olivier as vicar
general; and in 1808 Pius VII. divided Carroll&rsquo;s great diocese
into four sees, Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Bardstown
(Kentucky), suffragan to the metropolitanate of Baltimore, of
which Carroll actually became archbishop by the assumption
of the long delayed <i>pallium</i> on the 18th of August 1811, having
consecrated three suffragans in the autumn of 1810. In 1811
ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the Danish and Dutch West Indies
was bestowed upon him. Carroll was now an old man, and the
shock of the war of 1812, which as a staunch Federalist he had
opposed until its actual declaration, together with the action of
the Holy See in appointing to the sees of Philadelphia and New
York other candidates than those of his recommendation,
weighed on his mind. He died in Georgetown on the 3rd of
December 1815. He may well be reckoned the greatest figure
in the Roman Catholic Church of the United States. His position
in the church had never been easy, partly because he had been a
prominent member of the Society of Jesus. The great size of
his diocese had made it unwieldy; and his struggle to secure the
independence of the American church had been a difficult one.
As a defender of papal and episcopal authority he had, especially
in Philadelphia and Baltimore, to deal with churches whose
trustees insisted that they and their parishes alone could choose
priests, that bishop or prefect could not object to their choice.
Akin to this difficulty was the desire of Catholics of different
nationalities to have separate churches, a desire often created
or encouraged by intriguing and ambitious priests. Besides
these and other internal annoyances, Carroll had to meet the
deep-seated distrust of his church in communities settled almost
exclusively by Protestants.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARRONADE,<a name="ar64" id="ar64"></a></span> a piece of ordnance invented, by the application
of an old principle of gun construction, to serve as a ship&rsquo;s
gun. The inventor was the antiquary General Robert Melville
(1728-1809). He designed the piece in 1759, and called it the
&ldquo;smasher,&rdquo; but it was not adopted in the British navy till 1779,
and was then known as the &ldquo;carronade,&rdquo; from the Carron works
on the Carron river in Stirlingshire, Scotland, where it was first
cast by Mr Gascoigne. The carronade had a powder chamber
like many of the earliest guns known, and was similar to a mortar.
It was short, light, had a limited range, but was destructive at
close quarters. Carronades were added to the existing armaments
of guns proper or long guns. A 38-gun frigate carried
ten carronades, and was therefore armed with 48 pieces of
ordnance. As the official classifications were not changed, they
were misleading guides to the real strength of British ships,
which always carried more pieces than they were described as
carrying. The same remark applies to French and American
ships when the use of the carronade extended from the British
to other navies.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CARROT<a name="ar65" id="ar65"></a></span>. Wild carrot, <i>Daucus carota</i>, a member of the
natural order Umbelliferae, grows wild in fields and on roadsides
and sea-shores in Britain and the north temperate zone generally
of the Old World. It is an annual and resembles the cultivated
carrot, except in the root, which is thin and woody. It is the
origin of the cultivated carrot, which can be developed from it in
a few generations. M. Vilmorin succeeded in producing forms
with thick fleshy roots and the biennial habit in four generations.
In the cultivated carrot, during the first season of growth, the
stem remains short and bears a rosette of graceful, long-stalked,
branched leaves with deeply cut divisions and small, narrow
ultimate segments. During this period the plant devotes its
energies to storing food, chiefly sugar, in the so-called root,
which consists of the upper part of the true root and the short
portion of the stem between the root and the lowest leaves. A
transverse section of the root shows a central core, generally
yellow in colour, and an outer red or scarlet rind. The core
represents the wood of an ordinary stem and the outer ring the
soft outer tissue (bast and cortex). In the second season the
terminal bud in the centre of the leaf-rosette grows at the
expense of the stored nourishment and lengthens to form a
furrowed, rather rough, branched stem, 2 or 3 ft. high, and
bearing the flowers in a compound umbel. The umbel is characterized
by the fact that the small leaves (bracts) which
surround it, resemble the foliage leaves on a much reduced scale,
and ultimately curve inwards, the whole inflorescence forming
a nest-like structure. The flowers are small, the outer white,
the central ones often pink or purplish. The fruit consists of
two one-seeded portions, each portion bearing four rows of stiff
spinous projections, which cause the fruits when dropped to
cling together, and in a natural condition help to spread the
seed by clinging to the fur of animals. On account of these
projections the seeds cannot be sown evenly without previous
rubbing with sand or dry ashes to separate them. As usual in
the members of the order Umbelliferae, the wall of the fruit is
penetrated lengthwise by canals containing a characteristic oil.</p>

<p>Carrots vary considerably in the length, shape and colour of
their roots, and in the proportion of rind to core. The White
Belgian, which gives the largest crops, has a very thick root
which is white, becoming pale green above, where it projects
above ground. For nutritive purposes it is inferior to the red
varieties. The carrot delights in a deep sandy soil, which should
be well drained and deeply trenched. The ground should be
prepared and manured in autumn or winter. For the long-rooted
sorts the soil should be at least 3 ft. deep, but the Short
Horn varieties may be grown in about 6 in. of good compost laid
on the top of a less suitable soil. Peat earth may be usefully
employed in lightening the soil. Good carrots of the larger sorts
may be grown in unfavourable soils by making large holes 18 in.
deep with a crowbar, and filling them up with sandy compost
in which the seeds are to be sown. The main crop is sown at the
end of March or beginning of April. After sowing, it is only
necessary to thin the plants, and keep them clear of weeds.
The roots are taken up in autumn and stored during winter in
a cool shed or cellar.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARSIOLI<a name="ar67" id="ar67"></a></span> (mod. <i>Carsoli</i>), an ancient city of Italy, on the Via
Valeria, 42 m. E. by N. of Rome. It was founded in the country
of the Aequi between 302 and 298 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, just after the establishment
of Alba Fucens, no doubt as a stronghold to guard the road
to the latter. It is mentioned in 211 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> as one of the twelve out
of thirty Latin colonies which protested their inability to furnish
more men or money for the war against Hannibal. We find it
used in 168 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> like Alba Fucens as a place of confinement for
political prisoners. It was sacked in the Social War, but probably
became a <i>municipium</i> after it, though we hear but little of
it. The modern town of Carsoli first appears in a diploma of
<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 866, but the old site does not seem to have been abandoned
until the 13th century. It is now occupied only by vineyards,
and lies about 2100 ft. above sea-level, in a plain surrounded by
mountains, now called Piano del Cavaliere. The line of the city
walls (originally in tufa, and reconstructed in limestone), built
of rectangular blocks, can be traced, and so can the scanty
remains of several buildings, including the <i>podium</i> or base, of a
temple, and also the ancient branch road from the Via Valeria
(which itself keeps just south-east of Carsioli), traversing the
site from north to south. The forty-third milestone of the Via
Valeria still lies at or near its original site; it was set up by
Nerva in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 97. One mile to the north-west of Carsioli are the
remains of an ancient aqueduct consisting of a buttressed wall
of concrete crossing a valley.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARSON, CHRISTOPHER<a name="ar68" id="ar68"></a></span> [&rdquo;<span class="sc">Kit&rdquo;</span>] (1809-1868), American
hunter and scout, was born in Madison county, Kentucky, on
the 24th of December 1809. When he was a year old his parents
removed to Howard county, Missouri, then a frontier settlement,
and the boy was early trained in the hardships and requirements
of pioneer life. He served for a while as a saddler&rsquo;s apprentice,
and after 1826 devoted himself to the life of a professional guide
and hunter. He was hunter for the garrison at Bent&rsquo;s Fort on
the Arkansas river in what is now Bent county, Colorado, from
1832 to 1840, and accompanied John C. Frémont on his exploring
expeditions of 1842 and 1843-1844, and on his California expedition
in 1845-1846. Carson took part in the Mexican War, and,
after the rush to the Pacific Coast began, engaged as a guide to
convoy emigrants and drovers across the plains and mountains.
In 1854 he became Indian agent at Taos, New Mexico, in which
position, through his knowledge of the Indian traits and language,
he was able to exercise for many years a restraining influence
over the warlike Apaches and other tribes. During the Civil
War he rendered invaluable services to the Federal cause in the
south-west as chief scout in charge of the various bodies of
irregular scouts and rangers participating in the constant border
warfare that characterized the conflict in that part of the Union.
In March 1865 he was breveted brigadier-general of volunteers
for gallantry in the battle of Valverde (on the 21st of February
1862) and for distinguished services in New Mexico, and after the
war resumed his position as Indian agent, which he held until
his death at Fort Lyon, Colorado, on the 23rd of May 1868.
&ldquo;Kit&rdquo; Carson occupies in the latter period of American pioneer
history a position somewhat similar to that held by Daniel Boone
and David Crockett at an earlier period, as the typical frontier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page411" id="page411"></a>411</span>
hero and Indian fighter, and his hairbreadth escapes and personal
prowess are the subject of innumerable stories.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARSTARES<a name="ar70" id="ar70"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Carstairs</span>), <span class="bold">WILLIAM</span> (1649-1715), Scottish
clergyman, was born at Cathcart, near Glasgow, on the 11th of
February 1649, the son of the Rev. John Carstares, a member of
the extreme Covenanting party of Protestors. He was educated
at the university of Edinburgh, and then passed over to Utrecht,
where he commenced his lifelong friendship with the prince of
Orange, and began to take an active part in the politics of his
country. The government disliked Carstares for several reasons.
He was the intimate of William; he had been the bearer of
messages between the disaffected in Scotland and Holland;
and he was believed to be concerned with Sir James Steuart
(1635-1715) in the authorship of a pamphlet&mdash;<i>An Account of
Scotland&rsquo;s Grievances by reason of the D. of Lauderdale&rsquo;s Ministrie,
humbly tendered to his Sacred Majesty</i>. Accordingly, on his
return to England, at the close of 1674, he was committed to the
Tower; the following year he was transferred to Edinburgh
Castle, and it was not till August 1679 that he was released.
After this he visited Ireland, and then became pastor to a Nonconformist
congregation at Cheshunt. During 1682 he was in
Holland, but in the following year he was again in London, and
was implicated in the Rye House Plot. On its discovery he
was examined before the Scottish Council; though the torture
of the thumb-screw was applied, he refused to utter a word till
he was assured that his admissions would not be used in evidence,
and in the disclosures he then made he displayed great discretion.
On his return to Holland he was rewarded by William&rsquo;s still
warmer friendship, and the post of court chaplain; and after
the Revolution he continued to hold this office, under the title
of royal chaplain for Scotland. He was the confidential adviser
of the king, especially with regard to Scottish affairs, and
rendered important service in promoting the Revolution Settlement.
On the accession of Anne, Carstares retained his post as
royal chaplain, but resided in Edinburgh, having been elected
principal of the university. He was also minister of Greyfriars&rsquo;,
and afterwards of St Giles&rsquo;, and was four times chosen moderator
of the general assembly. He took an important part in promoting
the Union, and was consulted by Harley and other leading
Englishmen concerning it. During Anne&rsquo;s reign, the chief
object of his policy was to frustrate the measures which were
planned by Lord Oxford to strengthen the Episcopalian Jacobites&mdash;especially
a bill for extending the privileges of the Episcopalians
and the bill for replacing in the hands of the old patrons the
right of patronage, which by the Revolution Settlement had been
vested in the elders and the Protestant heritors. On the accession
of George I., Carstares was appointed, with five others,
to welcome the new dynasty in the name of the Scottish Church.
He was received graciously, and the office of royal chaplain was
again conferred upon him. A few months after he was struck
with apoplexy, and died on the 28th of December 1715.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARSTENS, ARMUS JACOB<a name="ar71" id="ar71"></a></span> (1754-1798), German painter,
was born in Schleswig, and in 1776 went to Copenhagen to study.
In 1783 he went to Italy, where he was much impressed by the
work of Giulio Romano. He then settled in Lübeck as a portrait
painter, but was helped to visit Rome again in 1792, and gradually
produced some fine subject and historical paintings, <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;Plato&rsquo;s
Symposium&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Battle of Rossbach&rdquo;&mdash;which made him
famous. He was appointed professor at Berlin, and in 1795 a
great exhibition of his works was held in Rome, where he died
in 1798. Carstens ranks as the founder of the later school of
German historical painting.</p>

The town was a <i>municipium</i>. The Via Flaminia is well preserved
and enters the north gate of the town, the archway of which still
stands. Remains of buildings may also be seen upon the site,
and the outline of an amphitheatre is visible. The town of Cesi,
3 m. to the south-east, has polygonal walls, and may perhaps be
regarded as an Umbrian city which was destroyed by the Romans,
Carsulae being constructed in its stead. The medieval city, as so
often happened in Italy, returned to the pre-Roman site.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CART<a name="ar73" id="ar73"></a></span> (A.S. <i>cr&oelig;t</i>, Gaelic <i>cairt</i>; connected with &ldquo;car&rdquo;), a
general term for various kinds of vehicles (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Carriage</a></span>), in
some cases for carrying people, but more particularly for transporting
goods, for agricultural or postal purposes, &amp;c., or for
carriers. Though constructed in various ways, the simplest type
for goods is two-wheeled, topless and springless; but as a general
term &ldquo;cart&rdquo; is used in combination with some more specific
qualification (dog-cart, donkey-cart, road-cart, polo-cart, &amp;c.),
when it is employed for pleasure purposes. The &ldquo;dog-cart,&rdquo; so
called because originally used to convey sporting dogs, is a more
or less elevated two-wheeled carriage, generally with scats back to
back, in front and behind; the &ldquo;governess-cart&rdquo; (presumably
so called from its use for children), a very low two-wheeled pony-carriage,
has two side seats facing inwards; the &ldquo;tax-cart,&rdquo; a

exempted from taxation as under the value of £21.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARTAGENA,<a name="ar74" id="ar74"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Carthagena</span>, a city, seaport, and the capital
of the department of Bolívar, Colombia, South America, on the
Caribbean coast, in 10° 25&prime; 48&Prime; N., 75° 34&prime; W. Pop. (1905,
official estimate) 14,000. The population of Cartagena is
largely composed of blacks and mixed races, which form the
predominant type on the lowland plains of northern Colombia.
The well-to-do whites of Cartagena usually have country houses
on the Turbaco hills, where the temperature is much lower than
on the coast. The mean annual temperature in the city is 82°,
and the port is classed as very unhealthful, especially for unacclimatized
foreigners. The harbour, which is the best on the north
coast of South America, is formed by an indentation of the coast-line
shut in by two long islands lying parallel to the mainland.
It covers an area of about 62.5 sq. m. and affords deep and
secure anchorages and ample facilities for loading and unloading
large vessels. The city itself has no modern quays, and large
vessels do not approach within a mile of its landing-stages, but
the railway pier (lengthened 120 ft. in 1898) on the mainland
opposite permits the mooring of vessels alongside. There were
formerly two entrances to the harbour&mdash;the Boca Grande (large
mouth) between the low sandy island or peninsula on which the
city stands and the island of Tierra Bomba, and the Boca Chica
(small mouth) at the south end of the latter island. The Boca
Grande was filled with stone after the city had been captured
three times, because of the ease with which an enemy&rsquo;s ships
could pass through it at any time, and the narrow and more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page412" id="page412"></a>412</span>
easily defended Boca Chica, 7 m. farther south, has since been
used.</p>

<p>The city occupies a part of the upper island or peninsula facing
the northern end of the harbour, and is separated from the mainland
on the east by a shallow lagoon-like extension of the bay
which is bridged by a causeway passing through the extramural
suburb of Xiximani on another island. The old city, about
¾ m. long, north and south, and ½ m. wide, is enclosed by a heavy
wall, in places 40 ft. thick, and is defended by several formidable-looking
forts, which have long been dismantled, but are still in a
good state of preservation. At the mainland end of the causeway
leading from the city is the fort of San Felipe, about 100 ft. above
sea-level, adapted as a distributing reservoir in the city&rsquo;s waterworks;
and behind it are verdure-covered hills rising to an
elevation of 500 ft., forming a picturesque background to the
grey walls and red-tiled roofs of the city. The streets are narrow,
irregular and roughly paved, but are lighted by electricity;
tramway lines run between the principal points of the city and
suburbs. The houses are built with thick walls of stone and
brick round open courts, in the Moorish style, and their iron-barred
doors and windows give them the appearance of being a
part of the fortifications. Among the numerous churches, the
largest and most imposing is the Jesuit church of San Juan de
Dios, with its double towers and celebrated marble pulpit; an
old monastery adjoins. Cartagena is an episcopal see, and its
cathedral dates from colonial times. The city was once the headquarters
of the Inquisition in South America, and the edifice
which it occupied, now private property, is an object of much
interest. The water supply of the city was formerly obtained
from rainwater tanks on the walls or by carriage from springs a
few miles inland. But in 1906 an English company received a
concession to bring water by pipes from springs on the Turbaco
hills, 300 ft. above the sea.</p>

<p>The commercial importance of Cartagena declined greatly
during the period of civil disorders which followed the war for
independence, but in later years has revived. In the reign of
Philip II. the Spaniards had opened a canal (&ldquo;El Dique&rdquo;)
through some marshes and lagoons into a small western outlet of
the Magdalena, which gave access to that river at Calamar, about
81 m. above the bar at its mouth; during Cartagena&rsquo;s decline
this was allowed to fill up; it was reopened in 1846 for a short
time and then was obstructed again by river floods; but in 1881
it was reopened for steam navigation. Towards the end of the
19th century a railway, 65 m. long, was built between Cartagena
and Calamar. Imports consist of cotton, linen and woollen
fabrics, hardware, cutlery and machinery, kerosene, glass and
earthenware; and the exports of cattle, sugar, tobacco, coffee,
coco-nuts and fibre, dividivi and dye-woods, vegetable ivory,
rubber, hides and skins, medicinal forest products, gold, silver
and platinum. The aggregate value of the exports in 1906 was
$3,788,094 U.S. gold.</p>

<p>Cartagena was founded in 1533 by Pedro de Heredia. In 1544
it was captured by pirates, who plundered the town; in 1585 by
Sir Francis Drake, who exacted a large ransom; and in 1697 by
the French, who obtained from it more than £1,000,000. In
1741 Admiral Vernon unsuccessfully besieged the town. It was
taken by Bolívar in 1815, but was surrendered to the royalists in
the same year. It was recaptured by the republicans on the 25th
of September 1821, and thereafter remained in their possession.
It figured prominently in the political agitations and revolutions
which followed, and underwent a siege in the civil war of 1885.
It was an important naval station under Spanish colonial rule,
and is the principal naval station of Colombia.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARTAGENA,<a name="ar75" id="ar75"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Carthagena</span>, a seaport of south-eastern

the terminus of a branch railway from the city of Murcia, and
on the Mediterranean Sea. Pop. (1900) 99,871. Cartagena is
fortified, and possesses an arsenal and naval dockyards. Together
with Ferrol and San Fernando near Cadiz, the other great
naval stations of Spain, it is governed by an admiral with the
title of captain-general. It has also an episcopal see.</p>

<p>The city stands on a hill separated by a little plain from the

fertile valley; on the south and west it is hemmed in by high
mountains. Its grey houses have a neglected, almost a dilapidated
appearance, from the friable stone of which they are
constructed; and there are no buildings of antiquarian interest
or striking architectural beauty, except, perhaps, the ruined
citadel and the remnants of the town walls. The wide streets
are traversed by a system of tramways, which pass through
modern suburbs to the mining district about two leagues inland,
and on the west a canal enables small vessels to enter the town
without using the port. The harbour, the largest in Spain after
that of Vigo, and the finest on the east coast, is a spacious bay,
deep, except near its centre, where there is a ledge of rock barely
5 ft. under water. It is dominated, on the seaward side, by four
hills, and approached by a narrow entrance, with forts on either
hand; a breakwater affords shelter on the east, and on the west
is the Arsenal Basin, often regarded as the original harbour of
the Carthaginians and Romans. The island called La Escombrera,
the ancient <i>Scombraria</i> (<i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;mackerel fishery&rdquo;), 2½ m.
south, protects Cartagena from the violence of wind and waves.
The mines near the city are very productive, and thousands of
men and beasts are employed in transporting lead, iron, copper,
zinc and sulphur to the coast. The industrial and commercial
progress of Cartagena was much hindered, during the first half
of the 19th century, by the prevalence of epidemic diseases,
the abandonment of the arsenal, and rivalry with the neighbouring
port of Alicante. Its sanitary condition, though still defective,
was improved by the drainage of the adjacent Almajar Marsh;
and after 1870, when the population had dwindled to about
26,000, Cartagena advanced rapidly in size and wealth. The
opening of the railway enabled it to compete successfully with
Alicante, and revived the mining and metallurgical industries,
while considerable sums were expended on bringing the coast
and land defences up to date, and adding new quays, docks and
other harbour works. As a naval station, Cartagena suffered
severely in 1898 from the maritime disasters of the Spanish-American
War; and its commerce was much affected when,
at the beginning of the same year, Porman, or Portman, a mining
village on a well-sheltered bay about 11 m. east, was declared by
royal order an independent port. Vessels go to Porman to land
coke and coal, and to load iron ore and lead. From Cartagena
the principal exports are metallic ores, esparto grass, wine,
cereals and fruit. Esparto grass, which grows freely in the
vicinity, is the <i>spartum</i>, or Spanish broom, which gave the town
its Roman designation of <i>Carthago Spartaria</i>. It is still used
locally for making shoes, ships&rsquo; cables, mats and a kind of spun
cloth. Timber is largely imported from the United States,
Sweden and Russia; coal from Great Britain; dried codfish
from Norway and Newfoundland. In 1904, exclusive of coasters
and small craft trading with north-west Africa, 662 ships of
604,208 tons entered the port of Cartagena, 259 being British
and 150 Spanish; while 90 vessels were accommodated at Porman.</p>

<p>Cartagena was founded about the year 243 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> by the Carthaginian
Hasdrubal, and was called <i>Carthago Nova</i> or New Carthage,
to distinguish it from the African city of Carthage. It was
conveniently situated opposite to the Carthaginian territory in
Africa, and was early noted for its harbour. Its silver and gold
mines were the source of great wealth both to the Carthaginians
and to the Romans. In 210 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> this important place, the
headquarters and treasure city of the Punic army, was stormed
and taken with great slaughter by P. Scipio. The city continued
to flourish under the Romans, who made it a colony, with the
name <i>Colonia Victrix Julia Nova Carthago</i>. In <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 425 it was
pillaged and nearly destroyed by the Goths. Cartagena was a
bishopric from about 400 to 1289, when the see was removed to
Murcia. Under the Moors it became an independent principality,
which was destroyed by Ferdinand II. of Castile in 1243, restored
by the Moors, and finally conquered by James I. of Aragon in
1276. It was rebuilt by Philip II. of Spain (1527-1598) for the
sake of its harbour. In 1585 it was sacked by an English fleet
under Sir Francis Drake. In 1706, in the War of the Spanish
Succession, it was occupied by Sir John Leake; and in the next
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page413" id="page413"></a>413</span>
year it was retaken by the duke of Berwick. On the 5th of
November 1823 it capitulated to the French. In consequence
of the insurrection in Spain, Cartagena was in 1844 again the
scene of warfare. On the 23rd of August 1873 it was bombarded
by the Spanish fleet under Admiral Lobos; on the 11th of
October a battle took place off the town, between the ships of
the government and the rebels, and on the 12th of January 1874
Cartagena was occupied by the government troops.</p>

Rica, Central America; 13 m. E.S.E. of San José by the trans-continental
railway. Pop. (1900) 4536. Cartago is built 4930 ft.
above sea-level, on the fertile and beautiful plateau of San José,
and at the southern base of the volcano Irazú (11,200 ft.). Some
of its older buildings, especially the churches, are of considerable
interest; but all bear marks of the volcanic disturbances from
which the town has suffered on many occasions&mdash;notably in
1723, when it was nearly overwhelmed by the bursting of the
flooded crater of Irazú, and in 1841, when it was shattered by an
earthquake. There are hot mineral springs much frequented
by invalids at Bella Vista, a suburb connected with the town by a
tramway 3 m. long. The local trade is chiefly in coffee of fine
quality, which is readily cultivated in the rich volcanic soil of the
neighbourhood. Cartago is said to have been in existence as
early as 1522; it was probably named in 1563 by the Spaniard
Vazquez de Coronado, to whom its foundation is often ascribed.
Though several times plundered by buccaneers, it retained its
importance as the capital of Costa Rica until 1823, when it is said
by tradition to have contained 30,000 inhabitants. Its prosperity
rapidly diminished after the transference of the seat of government
to San José, in 1823, but somewhat revived with the
development of railways after 1871.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARTE, THOMAS<a name="ar77" id="ar77"></a></span> (1686-1754), English historian, was born
at Dusmoon, near Clifton. He was educated at Oxford, and
was first brought into notice by his controversy with Dr Henry
Chandler regarding the Irish massacre, in which he defended
Charles I. His attachment to the Stuarts also caused him to
remain a non-juror, and on the discovery of the plot of Atterbury,
whose secretary he was, he was forced to flee to France. There
he collected materials for an English edition of De Thou and
Rigault, which were purchased and published by Dr Mead.
Being recalled to England through the influence of Queen
Caroline, he published, in 1738, <i>A General Account of the Necessary
Materials for a History of England</i>. The first volume of his
<i>Central History of England</i>, which is only of value for its vast
and careful collection of facts, was published in 1747. By the
insertion in it of the statement that the king&rsquo;s evil had been
cured by the Pretender, Carte forfeited the favour of most of
his patrons. He, however, continued to publish; and the 2nd
volume appeared in 1750, the 3rd in 1752, the 4th in 1755.
He published also a <i>Life of James, duke of Ormond</i>, containing
a collection of letters, &amp;c. (3 vols., 1735-1736; new ed., in 6 vols.,
Oxford, 1851), and a <i>History of the Revolutions of Portugal</i>, with
letters of Sir R. Southwell during his embassy there (London,
1740). His papers became the property of the university of
Oxford, and were deposited in the Bodleian library.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARTER, ELIZABETH<a name="ar78" id="ar78"></a></span> (1717-1806), English poet and translator,
daughter of the Rev. Nicholas Carter, was born at Deal,
in Kent, on the 16th of December 1717. Dr Carter educated
his children, boys and girls, alike; but Elizabeth&rsquo;s slowness tired
his patience, and it was only by great perseverance that she
conquered her natural incapacity for learning. She studied
late at night and early in the morning, taking snuff and chewing
green tea to keep herself awake; thus causing severe injury
to her health. She learned Greek and Latin, and Dr Johnson
said concerning a celebrated scholar that he &ldquo;understood
Greek better than any one whom he had ever known except
Elizabeth Carter.&rdquo; She learned also Hebrew, French, German,
Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and lastly some Arabic. She
studied astronomy, ancient geography, and ancient and modern
history. Edward Cave was a friend of Dr Carter, and in 1734
some of Elizabeth&rsquo;s verses, signed &ldquo;Eliza,&rdquo; appeared in the
<i>Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, to which she contributed for many years.
In 1738 Cave published her <i>Poems upon Particular Occasions</i>;
in 1739 she translated from the French an attack on Pope&rsquo;s
<i>Essay on Man</i> by J.P. de Crousaz; and in the same year
appeared her translation from the Italian of Algarotti&rsquo;s <i>Newtonianismo
per le Dame</i>, under the title of <i>Sir Isaac Newton&rsquo;s
Philosophy explained for the use of the Ladies, in six Dialogues
on Light and Colour</i>. Her translation of Epictetus (1758) was
undertaken in 1749 to please her friends, Thomas Secker (afterwards
archbishop of Canterbury) and his niece, Catherine
Talbot, to whom the translation was sent, sheet by sheet, as it
was done. In 1762 Miss Carter printed a second collection of
<i>Poems on Several Occasions</i>. Her letters to Miss Talbot contain
an account of a tour on the continent undertaken in 1763 in
company with Edward and Elizabeth Montagu and William
Pulteney, 1st earl of Bath. Dr Carter, from 1762 to his death
in 1774, lived with his daughter in a house at Deal, which she
had purchased. An annuity was settled on her by Sir William
Pulteney and his wife, who had inherited Lord Bath&rsquo;s fortune;
and she had another annuity from Mrs Montagu. Among
Miss Carter&rsquo;s friends and correspondents were Samuel Johnson,
Bishop Butler, Richard Savage, Horace Walpole, Samuel
Richardson, Edmund Burke, Hannah More, and Elizabeth Vesey,
who was a leader of literary society. She died in Clarges Street,
Piccadilly, on the 19th of February 1806.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARTERET, SIR GEORGE<a name="ar79" id="ar79"></a></span> (c. 1610-1680), English politician,
was born between 1609 and 1617 on the island of Jersey, where his
family had long been prominent landholders. He was the son
of Helier de Carteret of St Ouen, and in his youth was trained to
follow the sea. In 1639 he became comptroller of the English
navy. During the Civil War he was active in behalf of the king.
In 1643 he succeeded by reversion from his uncle, Sir Philip
Carteret, to the post of bailiff of Jersey, and in the same year
was appointed by the king lieutenant-governor of the island.
After subduing the Parliamentary party in the island, he was
commissioned (1644) a vice-admiral of Jersey and &ldquo;the maritime
parts adjacent,&rdquo; and by virtue of that office he carried on from
there an active privateering campaign in the Royalist cause.
Parliament branded him as a pirate and excluded him specifically
from future amnesty. His rule in Jersey was severe, but profitable
to the island; he developed its resources and made it a
refuge for Royalists, among whom in 1646 and again in 1649-1650
was Prince Charles, who created Carteret a knight and
baronet. In 1650, in consideration of Carteret&rsquo;s services, Charles
granted to him &ldquo;a certain island and adjacent islets near Virginia,
in America,&rdquo; which were to be called New Jersey; but no
settlement upon this grant was made. In 1651 Carteret, after
a seven weeks&rsquo; siege, was compelled to surrender Jersey to a
Parliamentary force; he then joined the Royalist exiles in France,
where for a time he held a command in the French navy. He
returned to England at the Restoration, became a privy councillor,
sat in parliament for Portsmouth, and also served as vice-chamberlain
of the royal household, a position to which he had been
appointed in 1647. From 1661 to 1667 he was treasurer of the
navy. He rendered valuable service during the Dutch War,
but his lax methods of keeping accounts led to his being censured
by parliament. In 1667 he became a deputy treasurer of Ireland.
He continued nevertheless in the royal favour, and subsequently
was appointed one of the commissioners of the admiralty and
a member of the board of trade and plantations. He belonged to
that group of courtiers interested in the colonization of America,
and was one of the eight to whom Charles II. granted the country
of the Carolinas by the charters of 1663 and 1665. In 1664
James, duke of York, granted that part of his American territory
between the Hudson and Delaware rivers to Sir George Carteret
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page414" id="page414"></a>414</span>
and John, Lord Berkeley, and in Carteret&rsquo;s honour this tract
received the name of New Jersey. Sir George&rsquo;s relative, Philip
Carteret (d. 1682), was sent over as governor in 1665, but was
temporarily deposed in 1672 by the discontented colonists,
who chose James Carteret (perhaps a natural son of Sir George)
as &ldquo;president.&rdquo; Philip Carteret was restored to his office in
1674. In this year Lord Berkeley disposed of his share of the
grant, which finally fell under the control of William Penn and
his associates. With them Carteret agreed (1676) upon a
boundary line which divided the colony into East and West
Jersey. He died in January 1680, and two years later his heirs
disposed of his New Jersey holdings to Penn and other Quakers.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CARTESIANISM,<a name="ar80" id="ar80"></a></span><a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> the general name given to the philosophy
developed principally in the works of Descartes, Malebranche and
Spinoza. It is impossible to exhibit the full meaning of these
authors except in connexion, for they are all ruled by one and
the same thought in different stages of its evolution. It may be
true that Malebranche and Spinoza were prepared, the former
by the study of Augustine, the latter by the study of Jewish
philosophy, to draw from Cartesian principles consequences which
Descartes never anticipated. But the foreign light did not alter
the picture on which it was cast, but only let it be seen more
clearly. The consequences were legitimately drawn. It may be
shown that they lay in the system from the first, and that they
were evolved by nothing but its own immanent dialectic. At
the same time it is not likely that they would ever have been
brought into such clear consciousness, or expressed with such
consistency, except by a philosopher whose circumstances and
character had completely detached him from all the convictions
and prejudices of the age. In Malebranche, Cartesianism found
an interpreter whose meditative spirit was fostered by the
cloister, but whose speculative boldness was restrained by the
traditions of the Catholic church. In Spinoza it found one
who was in spirit and position more completely isolated than any
monk, who was removed from the influence of the religious as well
as the secular world of his time, and who in his solitude seemed
scarcely ever to hear any voice but the voice of philosophy.
It is because Cartesianism found such a pure organ of expression
that its development is, in some sense, complete and typical.
Its principles have been carried to their ultimate result, and we
have before us all the data necessary to determine their value.</p>

<p><i>The Philosophy of Descartes.</i>&mdash;Descartes was, in the full sense
of the word, a partaker of the modern spirit. He was equally
moved by the tendencies that produced the Reformation, and
the tendencies that produced the revival of letters and science.
Like Erasmus and Bacon, he sought to escape from a transcendent
and unreal philosophy of the other world, to the knowledge
of man and the world he lives in. But like Luther, he
found within human experience, among the matters nearest to
man, the consciousness of God, and therefore his renunciation
of scholasticism did not end either in materialism or in that
absolute distinction between faith and reason which inevitably
leads to the downfall of faith. What was peculiar to Descartes,
however, was the speculative interest which made it impossible
for him to rest in mere experience, whether of things spiritual or
of things secular, which made him search, both in our consciousness
of God and our consciousness of the world, for the links
by which they are bound to the consciousness of self. In both
<span class="sidenote">Principle of doubt.</span>
cases it is his aim to go back to the beginning, to retrace
the unconscious process by which the world of experience
was built up, to discover the hidden logic
that connects the different parts of the structure of belief, to
substitute a reasoned system, all whose elements are interdependent,
for an unreasoned congeries of opinions. Hence his
first step involves reflection, doubt and abstraction. Turning
the eye of reason upon itself, he tries to measure the value of that
collection of beliefs of which he finds himself possessed; and the
first thing that reflection seems to discover is its accidental and
unconnected character. It is a mass of incongruous materials,
accumulated without system and untested. Its elements have
been put together under all kinds of influences, without any conscious
intellectual process, and therefore we can have no assurance
of them. In order that we may have such assurance we
must unweave the web of experience and thought which we have
woven in our sleep, that we may begin again at the beginning and
weave it over again with &ldquo;clear and distinct&rdquo; consciousness
of what we are doing. <i>De omnibus dubitandum est.</i> We must
free ourselves by one decisive effort from the weight of custom,
prejudice and tradition with which our consciousness of the world
has been overlaid, that in that consciousness in its simplest and
most elementary form we may find the true beginning of knowledge.
The method of doubt is at the same time a method of
abstraction, by which Descartes rises above the thought of the
particular objects of knowledge, in order that he may find the
primary truth in which lies the very definition of knowledge, of
the reason why anything can be said to be true. First disappears
the whole mass of dogmas and opinions as to God and man
which are confessedly received on mere authority. Then the
supposed evidence of sense is rejected, for external reality is not
immediately given in sensation. It is acknowledged by all that
the senses often mislead us as to the nature of things without us,
and perhaps they may also mislead us as to there being anything
without us at all. Nay, by an effort, we can even carry doubt
beyond this point; we can doubt even mathematical truth.
When, indeed, we have our thoughts directed to the geometrical
demonstration, when the steps of the process are immediately
before our minds, we cannot but assent to the proposition
that the angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles;
but when we forget or turn away our thoughts from such demonstration,
we can imagine that God or some powerful spirit is
playing upon our minds to deceive them, also that even our most
certain judgments may be illusory. In this naïve manner does
Descartes express the idea that there are necessities of thought
prior to, and presupposed in the truth of geometry. He is
seeking to strip thought of all the &ldquo;lendings&rdquo; that seem to
come to it from anything but itself, of all relation to being
that can be supposed to be given to it from without, that he may
discover the primary unity of thought and being on which all
<span class="sidenote">Certainty of the thinking self.</span>
knowledge depends. And this he finds in pure self-consciousness.
Whatever I abstract from, I cannot
abstract from self, from the &ldquo;I think&rdquo; that, as Kant
puts it, accompanies all our ideas; for it was in fact the
very independence of this universal element on the particulars
that made all our previous abstraction possible. Even doubt
rests on certitude; alone with self I cannot get rid of this self.
By an effort of thought I separate my thinking self from all
that I think, but the thinking self remains, and in thinking I
am. <i>Cogito, ergo sum</i>: &ldquo;I think, therefore I am.&rdquo; The objective
judgment of self-consciousness is bound up with or involved
in the very faculty of judging, and therefore remains when we
abstract from all other objective judgments. It is an assertion
involved in the very process by which we dismiss all other
assertions. Have we not then a right to regard it as a primitive
unity of thought and being, in which is contained, or out of which
may be developed, the very definition of truth?</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The sense in which Descartes understood his first principle becomes
clearer when we look at his answers to the objections made against it.
On the one hand it was challenged by those who asked,
like Gassendi, why the argument should be based especially
<span class="sidenote">Difficulties of the &ldquo;cogito, ergo sum.&rdquo;</span>
on thought, and why we might not say with as good
a right, <i>ambulo, ergo sum</i>: &ldquo;I walk, therefore I am.&rdquo;
Descartes explains that it is only as referred to consciousness
that walking is an evidence of my existence; but if I
say, &ldquo;I am conscious of walking, therefore I exist,&rdquo; this is equivalent
to saying, &ldquo;I think in one particular way, therefore I exist.&rdquo; But
it is not thinking in a particular way, but thinking in general that
is coextensive with my existence. I am not always conscious of
walking or of any other special state or object, but I am always
conscious, for except in consciousness there is no ego or self, and
where there is consciousness there is always an ego. &ldquo;Do I then always
think, even in sleep?&rdquo; asks the objector; and Descartes exposes
himself to the criticisms of Locke, by maintaining that it is impossible
that there should ever be an interval in the activity of
consciousness, and by insisting that as man is essentially a thinking
substance, the child thinks, or is self-conscious, even in its mother&rsquo;s
womb. The difficulty disappears when we observe that the question
as to the conditions under which self-consciousness is developed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page415" id="page415"></a>415</span>
the individual human subject does not affect the nature of self-consciousness
in itself or in its relation to knowledge. The force of
Descartes&rsquo;s argument really lies in this, that the world as an intelligible
world exists only for a conscious self, and that therefore the
unity of thought and being in self-consciousness is presupposed in
all knowledge. Of this self it is true to say that it exists only as it
thinks, and that it thinks always. <i>Cogito, ergo sum</i> is, as Descartes
points out, not a syllogism, but the expression of an identity which
is discerned by the simple intuition of the mind.<a name="fa2d" id="fa2d" href="#ft2d"><span class="sp">2</span></a> If it were otherwise,
the major &ldquo;<i>omne quod cogitat existit</i>&rdquo; would require to have
been known before the minor &ldquo;<i>cogito</i>&rdquo;; whereas on the contrary
it is from the immediate consciousness of being as contained in
self-consciousness that that major can alone be derived. Again, when
Hobbes and others argued that thinking is or may be a property
of a material substance, Descartes answers that the question whether
the material and the thinking substance are one does not meet us
at the outset, but can only be solved after we have considered what
is involved in the conception of these different substances respectively.<a name="fa3d" id="fa3d" href="#ft3d"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
In other words, to begin by treating thinking as a quality
of a material substance, is to go outside of the intelligible world for
an explanation of the intelligible world. It is to ask for something
prior to that which is first in thought. If it be true that the consciousness
of self is that from which we cannot abstract, that which is
involved in the knowledge of anything, then to go beyond it and seek
for a reason or explanation of it in anything else is to go beyond
the beginning of knowledge; it is to ask for a knowledge before
knowledge.</p>

<p>Descartes, however, is himself unfaithful to this point of view;
for, strictly taken, it would involve the consequence, not only that
there is nothing prior to the pure consciousness of self, but that
there can be no object which is not in necessary relation to it.
Hence there can be no absolute opposition between thought and
anything else, no opposition which thought itself does not transcend.
But Descartes commits the error of making thought the property
of a substance, a <i>res cogitans</i>, which as such can immediately or
directly apprehend nothing but thoughts or ideas; while, altogether
outside of these thoughts and ideas, there is another substance
characterized by the property of extension, and with which thought
has nothing to do. Matter in space is thus changed, in Kantian
language, into a &ldquo;thing in itself,&rdquo; an object out of all relation to
the subject; and on the other hand, mind seems to be shut up
in the magic circle of its own ideas, without any capacity of breaking
through the circle or apprehending any reality but itself. Between
thought and being, in spite of their <i>subjective</i> unity in self-consciousness,
a great gulf seems still to be fixed, which cannot be crossed
unless thought should become extended, or matter think. But to
Descartes the dualism is absolute, because it is a presupposition with
which he starts. Mind cannot go out of itself, cannot deal with
anything but thought, without ceasing to be mind; and matter
must cease to be matter ere it can lose its absolute externality, its
nature as having <i>partes extra partes</i>, and acquire the unity of mind.
They are opposed as the divisible and the indivisible, and there is
no possible existence of matter in thought except a representative
existence. The ideal (or, as Descartes calls it, objective) existence
of matter <i>in</i> thought and the real (or, as Descartes calls it, formal)
existence of matter <i>out of</i> thought are absolutely different and
independent things.</p>
</div>

<p>It was, however, impossible for Descartes to be content with
a subjective idealism that confined all knowledge to the tautological
expression of self-consciousness &ldquo;I am I,&rdquo;
&ldquo;What I perceive I perceive.&rdquo; If the individual is to
<span class="sidenote">Proof of existence of God.</span>
find in his self-consciousness the principle of all knowledge,
there must be something in it which transcends
the distinction of self and not self, which carries him beyond
the limit of his own individuality. What then is the point where
the subjective consciousness passes out into the objective,
from which it seemed at first absolutely excluded? Descartes
answers that it is through the connexion of the consciousness of
self with the consciousness of God. It is because we find God
in our minds that we find anything else. The proof of God&rsquo;s
existence is therefore the hinge on which the whole Cartesian
philosophy turns, and it is necessary to examine the nature of
it somewhat closely.</p>

<p>Descartes, in the first place, tries to extract a criterion of truth
out of the <i>cogito, ergo sum</i>. Why am I assured of my own existence?
It is because the conception of existence is at once and immediately
involved in the consciousness of self. I can logically distinguish
the two elements, but I cannot separate them; whenever I
clearly and distinctly conceive the one, I am forced to think the
other along with it. But this gives me a rule for all judgments
whatever, a principle which is related to the <i>cogito, ergo sum</i> as
the formal to the material principle of knowledge. Whatever
we cannot separate from the clear and distinct conception of
anything, necessarily belongs to it in reality; and on the other
hand, whatever we can separate from the clear and distinct
conception of anything, does not necessarily belong to it in
reality. Let us therefore set an object clearly before us, let us
sever it in thought so far as is possible from all other objects,
and we shall at once be able to determine what properties and
relations are essential and what are not essential to it. And if
we find empirically that any object manifests a property or
relation not involved in the clear and distinct conception of it,
we can say with certainty that such property or relation does not
belong to it except by arbitrary arrangement, or, in other words,
by the external combination of things which in their own nature
have no affinity or connexion.</p>

<p>Now, by the application of this principle, we might at once
assure ourselves of many mathematical truths; but, as has been
already shown, there is a point of view from which we may
doubt even these, so long as the idea of a God that deceives us
is not excluded. If it is not certain that there is a God that
cannot lie, it is not certain that there is an objective matter in
space to which mathematical truth applies. But the existence of
God may be proved in two ways. In the first place, it may be
proved through the principle of causality, which is a self-evident
truth. We have in our mind many ideas, and according to the
principle of causality, all these ideas must be derived from
something that contains a &ldquo;formal&rdquo; reality which corresponds
to their &ldquo;objective&rdquo; reality, <i>i.e.</i> which contains at least as
much reality in its existence out of thought as they contain in
their existence in thought. Now we might derive from ourselves
not only the ideas of other minds like ourselves, but possibly
also of material objects, since these are lower in the scale of
existence than ourselves, and it is conceivable that the idea of
them might be got by omitting some of the qualities which
distinguish ourselves. But the idea of God, of a being who is
eternal and immutable, all-powerful, all-wise, and all-good,
cannot be derived from our own limited and imperfect existence.
The origin, therefore, must be sought in a being who contains
actually in himself all that is contained in our idea of him.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It was objected by some of the critics of Descartes that the idea
of God as the infinite Being is merely negative, and that it is derived
from the finite simply by abstracting from its conditions.
Descartes answers that the case is just the reverse&mdash;the
<span class="sidenote">Descartes&rsquo;s metaphysics.</span>
infinite is the positive idea, and the finite is the negative,
and therefore the former is the presupposition of the latter.
As Kant, at a later date, pointed out that space is not a general
conception, abstracted from the ideas of particular spaces, and
representing the common element in them, but that, on the contrary,
the ideas of particular spaces are got by the limitation of the one
infinite space that is prior to them, so Descartes maintains in general
that the idea of the finite is had only by limitation of the infinite,
and not the idea of the infinite by abstraction from the particular
determinations of the finite. It is a necessary consequence of this
that the self-consciousness of a finite being is bound up with the
consciousness of the infinite. Hence the idea of God is not merely
one among other ideas which we have, but it is the one idea that is
necessary to our very existence as thinking beings, the idea through
which alone we can think ourselves, or anything else. &ldquo;I ought
never to suppose,&rdquo; says Descartes, &ldquo;that my conception of the
infinite is a negative idea, got by negation of the finite, just as I
conceive repose to be merely negation of movement, and darkness
merely the negation of light. On the contrary, I see manifestly
that there is more reality in the infinite than in the finite substance,
and that therefore I have in me the notion of the infinite, <i>even in
some sense prior to the notion of the finite</i>, or, in other words, that
the notion of myself in some sense presupposes the notion of God;
for how could I doubt or desire, how could I be conscious of anything
as a want, how could I know that I am not altogether perfect, if I
had not in me the idea of a being more perfect than myself, by comparison
with whom I recognize the defects of my own existence?&rdquo;<a name="fa4d" id="fa4d" href="#ft4d"><span class="sp">4</span></a>
Descartes then goes on in various ways to illustrate the thesis that
the consciousness of a defective and growing nature cannot give
rise to the idea of infinite perfection, but on the contrary presupposes
it. We could not think of a series of approximations unless there
were somehow present to us the idea of the completed infinite as the
goal we aim at. If we had not the consciousness of ourselves as
finite <i>in relation</i> to the infinite, either we should not be conscious of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page416" id="page416"></a>416</span>
ourselves at all, or we should be conscious of ourselves as infinite.
The image of God is so impressed by him upon us, that we &ldquo;conceive
that resemblance wherein the idea of God is contained by the
same faculty whereby we are conscious of ourselves.&rdquo; In other
words, our consciousness of ourselves is at the same time consciousness
of our finitude, and hence of our relation to a being who is
infinite.</p>

<p>The principle which underlies the reasoning of Descartes is that
to be conscious of a limit, is to transcend it. We could not feel the
limits either upon our thought or upon our existence, we could not
doubt or desire, if we did not already apprehend something beyond
these limits. Nay, we could not be conscious of our existence as
individual selves if we were not conscious of that which is not
ourselves, and of a unity in which both self and not-self are included.
Our individual life is therefore to us as self-conscious beings a part
of a wider universal life. Doubt and aspiration are but the manifestation
of this essential division and contradiction of a nature
which, as conscious of itself, is at the same time conscious of the
whole in which it is a part. And as the existence of a self and its
consciousness are one, so we may say that a thinking being is not
only an individual, but always in some sense identified with that
universal unity of being to which it is essentially related.</p>

<p>If Descartes had followed out this line of thought, he would have
been led at once to the pantheism of Spinoza, if not beyond it.
As it is, he is on the verge of contradiction with himself when he
speaks of the consciousness of God as <i>in some sense</i> prior to the consciousness
of self. How can anything be prior to the first principle
of knowledge? It is no answer to say that the consciousness of
God is the <i>principium essendi</i>, while the consciousness of self is the
<i>principium cognoscendi</i>. For, if the idea of God is prior to the idea
of self, knowledge must begin where existence begins, with God.
The words &ldquo;in some sense,&rdquo; with which Descartes qualifies his
assertion of the priority of the idea of God, only betray his hesitation
and his partial consciousness of the contradiction in which he is
involved. Some of Descartes&rsquo;s critics presented this difficulty to
him in another form, and accused him of reasoning in a circle when
he said that it is because God cannot lie that we are certain that our
clear and distinct ideas do not deceive us. The very existence of the
conscious self, the <i>cogito, ergo sum</i>, which is the first of all truths
and therefore prior in certitude to the existence of God, is believed
only because of the clearness and distinctness with which we apprehend
it. How then, they argued, could God&rsquo;s truthfulness be our
security for a principle which we must use in order to prove the
being of God? The answer of Descartes is somewhat lame. We
cannot doubt any self-evident principle, or even any truth based
on a self-evident principle, when we are directly contemplating it
in all the necessity of its evidence; it is only when we forget or turn
away from this evidence, and begin to think of the possibility of a
deceitful God, that a doubt arises which cannot be removed except
by the conviction that God is true.<a name="fa5d" id="fa5d" href="#ft5d"><span class="sp">5</span></a> It can scarcely be said that
this is a <i>dignus vindice nodus</i>, or that God can fitly appear as a
kind of second-best resource to the forgetful spirit that has lost its
direct hold on truth and its faith in itself. God, truth, and the human
spirit are thus conceived as having merely external and accidental
relations with each other. What Descartes, however, is really expressing
in this exoteric way is simply that beneath and beyond all
particular truths lies the great general truth of the unity of thought
and existence. In contemplating particular truth, we may not
consciously relate it to this unity, but when we have to defend
ourselves against scepticism we are forced to realize this relation.
The ultimate answer to any attack upon a special aspect or element
of truth must be to show that the fate of truth itself, the very
possibility of knowledge, is involved in the rejection of it, and that
we cannot doubt it without doubting reason itself. But to doubt
reason is, in the language of Descartes, to doubt the truthfulness of
God, for, in his view, the idea of God is involved in the very constitution
of reason. Taken in this way then, the import of Descartes&rsquo;s
answer is, that the consciousness of self, like every other particular
truth, is not at first seen to rest on the consciousness of God, but
that when we realize what it means we see that it does so rest.
But if this be so, then in making the consciousness of self his first
principle of knowledge, Descartes has stopped short of the truth.
It can only be the first principle if it is understood, not as the
consciousness of the individual self, but in a sense in which the
consciousness of self is identical with the consciousness of God.</p>

<p>Descartes, however, is far from a clear apprehension of the ultimate
unity of thought and being, which nevertheless he strives to find in
God. Beginning with an absolute separation of the <i>res cogitans</i>
from the <i>res extensa</i>, he is continually falling back into dualism
just when he seemed to have escaped from it. Even in God the
absolute unity, idea and reality fall asunder; our idea of God is not
God in us, it is only an idea of which God&rsquo;s existence is the cause.
But the category of causality, if it forms a bridge between different
things, as here between knowing and being, at the same time repels
them from each other. It is a category of external relation which
may be adequate to express the relation of the finite to the finite,
but not the relation of the finite to the infinite. We cannot conceive
God as the cause of our idea of him, without making God a purely
objective and therefore finite existence. Nor is the case better
when we turn to the so-called ontological argument,&mdash;that existence
is necessarily involved in the idea of God, just as the property of
having its angles equal to two right angles is involved in the idea of
a triangle. If indeed we understood this as meaning that thought
transcends the distinction between itself and existence, and that
therefore existence cannot be a thing in itself out of thought, but
must be an intelligible world that exists as such only for the thinking
being, there is some force in the argument. But this meaning we
cannot find in Descartes, or to find it we must make him inconsistent
with himself. He was so far from having quelled the phantom
&ldquo;thing in itself,&rdquo; that he treated matter in space as such a thing,
and thus confused externality of space with externality to the mind.
On this dualistic basis, the ontological argument becomes a manifest
paralogism, and lies open to all the objections that Kant brought
against it. That the idea of God involves existence, proves only
that God, if he exists at all, exists by the necessity of his being.
But the link that shall bind thought to existence is still wanting,
and, in consistency with the other presuppositions of Descartes, it
cannot be supplied.</p>

<p>But again, even if we allow to Descartes that God is the unity of
thought and being, we must still ask what kind of unity? Is it a
mere generic unity, reached by abstraction, and therefore leaving
out all the distinguishing characteristics of the particulars under it?
Or is it a concrete unity to which the particular elements are subordinated,
but in which they are nevertheless included? To answer
this question, we need only look at the relation of the finite to the
infinite, as it is expressed in that passage already quoted, and in
many others. Descartes always speaks of the infinite as a purely
affirmative or positive existence, and of the finite in so far as it is
distinguished from the infinite, as purely negative, or in other words
as a nonentity. &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;a mean between God and
nothing, between the Supreme Being and not-being. In so far as I
am created by God, there is nothing in me that can deceive me
or lead me into error. But on the other hand, if I consider myself
as participating in nothingness or not-being, inasmuch as I am not
myself the Supreme Being, but in many ways defective, I find myself
exposed to an infinity of errors. Thus error as such is not something
real that depends on God, but simply a defect; I do not need to
explain it by means of any special faculty bestowed on me by God,
but merely by the fact that the faculty for discerning truth from
error with which he has endowed me, is not infinite.&rdquo;<a name="fa6d" id="fa6d" href="#ft6d"><span class="sp">6</span></a> But if we
follow out this principle to its logical result, we must say not only
that error is a consequence of finitude, but also that the very <i>existence</i>
of the finite as such is an error or illusion. All finitude, all determination,
according to the well-known Spinozistic aphorism, is negation,
and negation cannot constitute reality. To know the reality of
things, therefore, we have to abstract from their limits, or in other
words, the only reality is the infinite. Finite being, <i>qua</i> finite, has
no existence, and finite self-consciousness, consciousness of a self
in opposition to or limited by a not-self, is an illusion. But Descartes
does not thus reason. He does not see &ldquo;anything in the nature of
the infinite which should exclude the existence of finite things.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What,&rdquo; he asks, &ldquo;would become of the power of that imaginary
infinite if it could create nothing? Perceiving in ourselves the
power of thinking, we can easily conceive that there should be a
greater intelligence elsewhere. And even if we should suppose that
intelligence increased <i>ad infinitum</i>, we need not fear that our own
would be lessened. And the same is true of all other attributes
which we ascribe to God, even of his power, provided only that we
do not suppose that the power in us is not subjected to God&rsquo;s will.
In all points, therefore, he is infinite without any exclusion of created
things.&rdquo;<a name="fa7d" id="fa7d" href="#ft7d"><span class="sp">7</span></a> The truth of this view we need not dispute; the question
is as to its consistency with Cartesian principles. It may be a higher
idea of God to conceive him as revealing himself in and to finite
creatures; but it is a different idea from that which is implied in
Descartes&rsquo;s explanations of error. It is an inconsistency that brings
Descartes nearer to Christianity, and nearer, it may also be said,
to a true metaphysic; but it is not the less an inconsistency with
his fundamental principles, which necessarily disappears in their
subsequent development. To conceive the finite as constituted not
merely by the absence of some of the positive elements of the infinite,
but as in necessary unity with the infinite; to conceive the infinite
as not merely that which has no limits or determinations, but as
that which is self-determined and self-manifesting, which through all
finitude and manifestation returns upon itself, may not be erroneous.
But it would not be difficult to show that the adoption of such a
conception involves the rejection or modification of almost every
doctrine of the Cartesian system.</p>

<p>In connexion with this inconsistency we may notice the very
different relations in which Descartes conceives mind on the one side
and matter on the other, to stand towards God, who yet
is the cause of both, and must therefore, by the principle
<span class="sidenote">Mind and matter.</span>
of causality, contain in himself all that is in both. Matter
and mind are to Descartes absolute opposites. Whatever can
be asserted of mind can be denied of matter, whatever can be
asserted of matter can be denied of mind. Matter is passive, mind
is active; matter is extended, and therefore divisible <i>ad infinitum</i>;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page417" id="page417"></a>417</span>
mind is an indivisible unity. In fact, though of this Descartes is
not conscious, the determination of the one is mediated by its
opposition to the other; the ideas of object and subject, the self
and not-self, are terms of a relation distinguishable but inseparable.
But in the idea of God we must find a unity which transcends this
difference in one way or another, whether by combining the two
under a higher notion, or, as it would be more natural to expect on
Cartesian principles, by abstracting equally from the particular
characteristics of both. Descartes really does neither, or rather he
acts partly on the one principle and partly on the other. In his idea
of God he abstracts from the properties of matter but not from those
of mind. &ldquo;God,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;contains in himself <i>formaliter</i> all that
is in mind, but only <i>eminenter</i> all that is in matter&rdquo;;<a name="fa8d" id="fa8d" href="#ft8d"><span class="sp">8</span></a> or, as he
elsewhere expresses it more popularly, he <i>is</i> mind, but he is only
the creator of matter. And for this he gives as his reason, that
matter as being divisible and passive is essentially imperfect. <i>Ipsa
natura corporis multas imperfectiones involvit</i>, and, therefore, &ldquo;there
is more analogy between sounds and colours than there is between
material things and God.&rdquo; But the real imperfection here lies in the
abstractness of the Cartesian conception of matter as merely
extended, merely passive; and this is balanced by the equal abstractness
of the conception of mind or self-consciousness as an absolutely
simple activity, a pure intelligence without any object but itself.
If matter as absolutely opposed to mind is imperfect, mind as
absolutely opposed to matter is equally imperfect. In fact they are
the elements or factors of a unity, and lose all meaning when severed
from each other, and if we are to seek this unity by abstraction, we
must equally abstract from both.</p>

<p>The result of this one-sidedness is seen in the fact that Descartes,
who begins by separating mind from matter, ends by finding the
essence of mind in pure will, <i>i.e.</i> in pure formal self-determination.
Hence God&rsquo;s will is conceived as absolutely
<span class="sidenote">Reason and will.</span>
arbitrary, not determined by any end or law, for all laws,
even the necessary truths that constitute reason, spring from
God&rsquo;s determination, and do not precede it. &ldquo;He is the author
of the essence of things no less than their existence,&rdquo; and his will
has no reason but his will. In man there is an intelligence with
eternal laws or truths involved in its structure, which so far limits
his will. &ldquo;He finds the nature of good and truth already determined
by God, and his will cannot be moved by anything else.&rdquo; His
highest freedom consists in having his will determined by a clear
perception of the nature of good and truth, and &ldquo;he is never indifferent
except when he is ignorant of it, or at least does not see it
so clearly as to be lifted above the possibility of doubt.&rdquo;<a name="fa9d" id="fa9d" href="#ft9d"><span class="sp">9</span></a> Indifference
of will is to him &ldquo;the lowest grade of liberty,&rdquo; yet, on the
other hand, in nothing does the image of God in him show itself
more clearly than in the fact that his will is not limited by his
clear and distinct knowledge, but is &ldquo;in a manner infinite.&rdquo; For
&ldquo;there is no object of any will, even the infinite will of God, to
which our will does not extend.&rdquo;<a name="fa10d" id="fa10d" href="#ft10d"><span class="sp">10</span></a> Belief is a free act, for as we
can yield our assent to the obscure conceptions presented by sense
and the imagination, and thus allow ourselves to be led into error,
so on the other hand we can refuse to give this assent, or allow ourselves
to be determined by anything but the clear and distinct ideas
of intelligence. That which makes it possible for us to err is that
also in which the divine image in us is most clearly seen. We cannot
have the freedom of God whose will creates the object of his knowledge;
but in reserving our assent for the clear and distinct
perceptions of intelligence, we, as it were, re-enact for ourselves
the divine law, and repeat, so far as is possible to finite beings, the
transcendent act of will in which truth and good had their origin.</p>

<p>The inherent defect of this view is the divorce it makes between the
form and the matter of intelligence. It implies that reason or self-consciousness
is one thing, and that truth is another and quite
different thing, which has been united to it by the arbitrary will of
God. The same external conception of the relation of truth to the
mind is involved in the doctrine of innate ideas. It is true that
Descartes did not hold that doctrine in the coarse form in which it
was attributed to him by Locke, but expressly declares that he has
&ldquo;never said or thought at any time that the mind required innate
ideas which were separated from the faculty of thinking. He had
simply used the word innate to distinguish those ideas which are
derived from that faculty, and not from external objects or the
determination of the will. Just as when we say generosity is innate
in certain families, and in certain others diseases, like the gout or
the stone, we do not mean to imply that infants in their mother&rsquo;s
womb are affected with these complaints.&rdquo;<a name="fa11d" id="fa11d" href="#ft11d"><span class="sp">11</span></a> Yet Descartes, as we
have seen, does not hold that these truths are involved in the very
nature of intelligence as such, so that we cannot conceive a self-conscious
being without them. On the contrary, we are to regard
the divine intelligence as by arbitrary act determining that two and
two should be four, or that envy should be a vice. We are &ldquo;<i>not</i> to
conceive eternal truth flowing from God as rays from the sun.&rdquo;<a name="fa12d" id="fa12d" href="#ft12d"><span class="sp">12</span></a>
In other words, we are not to conceive all particular truths as
different aspects of one truth. It is part of the imperfection of
man&rsquo;s finite nature that he &ldquo;finds truth and good determined for
him.&rdquo; It is something given,&mdash;given, indeed, along with his very
faculty of thinking, but still <i>given</i> as an external limit to it. It
belongs not to his nature as spirit, but to his finitude as man.</p>

<p>After what has been said, it is obvious that the transition from
God to matter must be somewhat arbitrary and external. God&rsquo;s
truthfulness is pledged for the reality of that of which we
have <i>clear and distinct ideas</i>; and we have clear and
<span class="sidenote">Truth of external world.</span>
distinct ideas of the external world so long as we conceive
it simply as extended matter, infinitely divisible, and
moved entirely from without,&mdash;so long, in short, as we conceive it
as the direct opposite of mind, and do not attribute to it any one
of the properties of mind. &ldquo;Omnes proprietates, quas in ea clare
percipimus, ad hoc unum reducuntur, quod sit partibilis et mobilis,
secundum partes.&rdquo; We must, therefore, free ourselves from the
obscure and confused modes of thought which arise whenever we
attribute any of the secondary qualities, which exist merely in our
sensations, to the objects that cause these sensations. The subjective
character of such qualities is proved by the constant change
which takes place in them, without any change of the object in
which they are perceived. A piece of wax cannot lose its extension;
but its colour, its hardness, and all the other qualities whereby it is
presented to sense, may be easily altered. What is objective in all
this is merely an extended substance, and the modes of motion
or rest through which it is made to pass. In like manner we must
separate from our notion of matter all ideas of <i>actio in distans</i>&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>
we must explain weight not as a tendency to the centre of the earth
or an attraction of distant particles of matter, but as a consequence
of the pressure of other bodies, immediately surrounding that which
is felt to be heavy.<a name="fa13d" id="fa13d" href="#ft13d"><span class="sp">13</span></a> For the only conceivable <i>actio in distans</i> is
that which is mediated by thought, and it is only in so far as we
suppose matter to have in it a principle of activity like thought,
that we can accept such explanations of its motion. Again, while
we must thus keep our conception of matter clear of all elements
that do not belong to it, we must also be careful not to take away
from it those that <i>do</i> belong to it. It is a defect of distinctness in
our ideas when we conceive an attribute as existing apart from its
substance, or a substance without its attribute; for this is to treat
elements that are only separated by a &ldquo;distinction of reason,&rdquo; as
if they were distinct things. The conception of the possibility of a
vacuum or empty space arises merely from our confusing the possible
separation of any mode or form of matter from matter in general
with the impossible separation of matter in general from its own
essential attribute. Accordingly, in his physical philosophy,
Descartes attempts to explain everything on mechanical principles,
starting with the hypothesis that a certain quantity of motion
has been impressed on the material universe by God at the first, a
quantity which can never be lost or diminished, and that space is an
absolute plenum in which motion propagates itself in circles.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to follow Descartes into the detail of the theory
of vortices. It is more to the purpose to notice the nature of the
reasons by which he is driven to regard such a mechanical
explanation of the universe as necessary. A real or substantive
<span class="sidenote">Material universe a mechanism.</span>
existence is, in his view, a <i>res completa</i>, a thing
that can be conceived as a whole in itself without relations
to any other thing. Now matter and mind are, he
thinks, such complete existences, so long as we conceive them, as
pure intelligence must conceive them, as abstract opposites of each
other; and do not permit ourselves to be confused by those mixed
modes of thought which are due to sense or imagination. Descartes
does not see that in this very abstract opposition there is a bond
of union between mind and matter, that they are correlative
opposites, and therefore in their separation <i>res incompletae</i>. In
other words, they are merely elements of reality substantiated by
abstract thought into independent realities. He indeed partly
retracts his assertion that mind and matter severed from each other
are <i>res completae</i>, when he declares that neither can be conceived
as existing apart from God, and that therefore, strictly speaking,
God alone is a substance. But, as we have seen, he avoids the
necessary inference that in God the opposition between mind and
matter is reconciled or transcended, by conceiving God as abstract
self-consciousness or will, and the material world not as his necessary
manifestation, but simply as his creation,&mdash;as having its origin in
an act of bare volition and that only. His God is the God of monotheism
and not of Christianity, and therefore the world is to God
always a foreign matter which he brings into being, and acts on
from without, but in which he is not revealed.</p>

<p>It is a natural consequence of this view that nature is essentially
<i>dead matter</i>, that beyond the motion it has received from God at the
beginning, and which it transmits from part to part
without increase or diminution, it has no principle of
<span class="sidenote">Animals automata.</span>
activity in it. Every trace of vitality in it must be
explained away as a mere false reflection upon it of the nature of
mind. The world is thus &ldquo;cut in two with a hatchet,&rdquo; and there
is no attraction to overcome the mutual repulsion of its severed
parts. Nothing can be admitted in the material half that savours of
self-determination, all its energy must be communicated, not self-originated;
there is no room for gravitation, still less for magnetism
or chemical affinity, in this theory. <i>A fortiori</i>, animal life must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page418" id="page418"></a>418</span>
completely explained away. The machine may be very complicated,
but it is still, and can be nothing but, a machine. If we once admitted
that matter could be anything but mechanical, we should be
on the way to admit that matter could become mind. When a
modern physical philosopher declares that everything, even life and
thought, is ultimately reducible to matter, we cannot always be
certain that he means what he seems to say. Not seldom the
materialist <i>soi-disant</i>, when we hear his account of the properties
of matter, turns out to be something like a spiritualist in disguise;
but when Descartes asserted that everything <i>but</i> mind is material,
and that the animals are automata, there is no such dubiety of
interpretation. He said what he meant, and meant what he said,
in the hardest sense his words can bear. <i>His</i> matter was not even
gravitating, much less living; it had no property except that of
retaining and transmitting the motion received from without by
pressure and impact. And <i>his</i> animals were automata, not merely
in the sense of being governed by sensation and instinct, but precisely
in the sense that a watch is an automaton. Henry More cries out
against the ruthless consequence with which he develops his principles
to this result. &ldquo;In this,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I do not so much admire the
penetrative power of your genius as I tremble for the fate of the
animals. What I recognize in you is not only subtlety of thought,
but a hard and remorseless logic with which you arm yourself as
with a sword of steel, to take away life and sensation with one blow,
from almost the whole animal kingdom.&rdquo; But Descartes was not
the man to be turned from the legitimate result of his principles by
a scream. &ldquo;Nec moror astutias et sagacitates canum et vulpium,
nec quaecunque alia propter cibum, venerem, aut metum a brutis
fiunt. <i>Profiteor enim me posse perfacile illa omnia ut a sola membrorum
conformatione profecta explicare.</i>&rdquo;<a name="fa14d" id="fa14d" href="#ft14d"><span class="sp">14</span></a></p>

<p>The difficulty reaches its height when Descartes attempts to
explain the union of the body and spirit in man. Between two
substances which, when clearly and distinctly conceived,
do not imply each other, there can be none but an artificial
<span class="sidenote">Nature of sensation.</span>
unity,&mdash;a unity of composition that still leaves them
external to each other. Even God cannot make them one in any
higher sense.<a name="fa15d" id="fa15d" href="#ft15d"><span class="sp">15</span></a> And as it is impossible in the nature of mind to see
any reason why it should be embodied, or in the nature of matter
to see any reason why it should become the organ of mind, the union
of the two must be taken as a mere empirical fact. When we put
on the one side all that belongs to intelligence, and on the other
all that belongs to matter, there is a residuum in our ideas which we
cannot reduce to either head. This residuum consists of our appetites,
our passions, and our sensations, including not only the feelings of
pain and pleasure, but also the perceptions of colour, smell, taste, of
hardness and softness, and all the other qualities apprehended by
touch. These must be referred to the union of mind with body.
They are subjective in the sense that they give us no information
as to the nature either of things or of mind. Their function is only
to indicate what things are useful or hurtful to our composite nature
as such, or in other words what things tend to confirm or dissolve
the unity of mind and body. They indicate that <i>something</i> is taking
place in our body, or without it, and so stimulate us to some kind of
action, but <i>what</i> it is that is taking place they do not tell us. There
is no resemblance in the sensation of pain produced by great heat to
the rending of the fibres of our body that causes it. But we do not
need to know the real origin of our sensation to prevent us going
too near the fire. Sensation leads us into error only when we are not
conscious that its office is merely practical, and when we attempt
to make objective judgments by means of its obscure and confused
ideas, <i>e.g.</i> when we say that there is heat in our hands or in the fire.
And the remedy for this error is to be found simply in the clear
conviction of the subjectivity of sensation.</p>

<p>These views of the nature of sense, however, at once force us to
ask how Descartes can consistently admit that a subjective result
such as sensation, a result in mind, should be produced
by matter, and on the other hand how an objective result,
<span class="sidenote">Theory of occasional causes.</span>
a result in matter, should be effected by mind. Descartes
explains at great length, according to his modification of
the physiology of the day, that the pineal gland, which is the immediate
organ of the soul, is acted on by the nerves through the
&ldquo;animal spirits,&rdquo; and again by reaction upon these spirits produces
motions in the body. It is an obvious remark that this explanation
either materializes mind, or else puts for the solution the very problem
to be solved. It was therefore in the spirit of Descartes, it was only
making explicit what is involved in many of his expressions, when
Geulincx, one of his earliest followers, formulated the theory of
occasional causes. The general approval of the Cartesian school
proved that this was a legitimate development of doctrine. Yet it
tore away the last veil from the absolute dualism of the system,
which had so far stretched the antagonism of mind and matter
that no mediation remained possible, or what is the same thing,
remained possible only through an inexplicable will of God. The
intrusion of such a <i>Deus ex machina</i>into philosophy only showed
that philosophy by its violent abstraction had destroyed the unity
of the known and intelligible world, and was, therefore, forced to
seek that unity in the region of the unknown and unintelligible.
If our light be darkness, then in our darkness we must seek for light;
if reason be contradictory in itself, truth must be found in unreason.
The development of the Cartesian school was soon to show what is the
necessary and inevitable end of such worship of the unknown.</p>

<p>To the ethical aspect of his philosophy, Descartes, unlike Spinoza,
only devoted a subordinate attention. In a short treatise, however,
he discussed the relation of reason to the passions. After
we have got over the initial difficulty, that matter should
<span class="sidenote">Ethics.</span>
give rise to effects in mind, and mind in matter, and have admitted
that in man the unity of mind and body turns what in the animals
is mere mechanical reception of stimulus from without and reaction
upon it into an action and reaction mediated by sensation, emotion
and passion, another question presents itself. How can the mere
natural movement of passion, the nature of which is fixed by the
original constitution of our body, and of the things that act upon
it, be altered or modified by pure reason? For while it is obvious
that morality consists in the determination of reason by itself, it is
not easy to conceive how the same being who is determined by
passion from without should also be determined by reason from
within. How, in other words, can a spiritual being maintain its
character as self-determined, or at least determined only by the clear
and distinct ideas of the reason which are its innate forms, in the
presence of this foreign element of passion that seems to make it
the slave of external impressions? Is reason able to crush this
intruder, or to turn it into a servant? Can the passions be annihilated,
or can they be spiritualized? Descartes could not properly
adopt either alternative; he could not adopt the ethics of asceticism,
for the union of body and mind is, in his view, natural; and hence
the passions which are the results of that union are in themselves good.
They are provisions of nature for the protection of the unity of soul
and body, and stimulate us to the acts necessary for that purpose.
Yet, on the other hand, he could not admit that these passions are
capable of being completely spiritualized; for so long as the unity
of body and soul is regarded as merely external and accidental, it is
impossible to think that the passions which arise out of this unity
can be transformed into the embodiment and expression of reason.</p>

<p>Descartes, indeed, points out that every passion has a lower and
a higher form, and while in its lower or primary form it is based
on the obscure ideas produced by the motion of the animal spirits,
in its higher form it is connected with the clear and distinct judgments
of reason regarding good and evil. If, however, the unity
of soul and body be a unity of composition, there is an element of
obscurity in the judgments of passion which cannot be made clear,
an element in desire that cannot be spiritualized. If the mind be
external to the passions it can only impose upon them an external
rule of moderation. On such a theory no <i>ideal</i> morality is possible
to man in his present state; for, in order to the attainment of such
an ideal morality, it would be necessary that the accidental element
obtruded into his life as a spiritual being by his connexion with the
body should be expelled. What can be attained under present conditions
is only to abstract so far as is possible from external things,
and those relations to external things into which passion brings us.
Hence the great importance which Descartes attaches to the distinction
between things in our power and things not in our power.
What is not in our power includes all outward things, and therefore
it is our highest wisdom to regard them as determined by an absolute
fate, or the eternal decree of God. We cease to wish for the impossible;
and therefore to subdue our passions we only need to
convince ourselves that no effort of ours can enable us to secure
their objects. On the other hand, that which is within our power,
and which, therefore, we cannot desire too earnestly, is virtue.
But virtue in this abstraction from all objects of desire is simply
the harmony of reason with itself, the <span class="grk" title="ataraxia">&#7936;&#964;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#958;&#943;&#945;</span> of the Stoic under
a slight change of aspect. Thus in ethics, as in metaphysics,
Descartes ends not with a reconciliation of the opposed elements,
but with a dualism, or at best, with a unity which is the result of
abstraction.</p>

<p><i>The Philosophy of Malebranche.</i>&mdash;Malebranche was prepared,
by the ascetic training of the cloister and the teaching of Augustine,
to bring to clear consciousness and expression many of the
tendencies that were latent and undeveloped in the philosophy
of Descartes. To use a chemical metaphor, the Christian
Platonism of the church father was a medium in which Cartesianism
could precipitate the product of its elements. Yet the medium
was, as we shall see, not a perfect one, and hence the product
was not quite pure. Without metaphor, Malebranche, by his
previous habits of thought, was well fitted to detect and develop
the pantheistic and ascetic elements of his master&rsquo;s philosophy.
But he was not well fitted to penetrate through the veil of popular
language under which the discordance of that philosophy with
orthodox Christianity was hidden. On the contrary, the whole
training of the Catholic priest, and especially his practical spirit,
with that tendency to compromise which a practical spirit
always brings with it, enabled him to conceal from himself as
well as from others the logical result of his principles. And we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page419" id="page419"></a>419</span>
do not wonder even when we find him treating as a &ldquo;miserable&rdquo;
the philosopher who tore away the veil.</p>

<p>Malebranche saw &ldquo;<i>all things in God.</i>&rdquo; In other words, he
taught that knowledge is possible only in so far as thought is
the expression, not of the nature of the individual subject as
such, but of a universal life in which he and all other rational
beings partake. &ldquo;No one can feel my individual pain; every
one can see the truth which I contemplate&mdash;why is it so? The
reason is that my pain is a modification of my substance, but
truth is the common good of all spirits.&rdquo;<a name="fa16d" id="fa16d" href="#ft16d"><span class="sp">16</span></a> This idea is ever
present to Malebranche, and is repeated by him in an endless
variety of forms of expression. Thus, like Descartes, but with
more decision, he tells us that the idea of the infinite is prior to
the idea of the finite. &ldquo;We conceive of the infinite being by
the very fact that we conceive of being without thinking whether
it be finite or no. But in order that we may think of a finite
being, we must necessarily cut off or deduct something from the
general notion of being, which consequently we must previously
possess. Thus the mind does not apprehend anything whatever,
except in and through the idea that it has of the infinite; and
so far is it from being the case that this idea is formed by the
confused assemblage of all the ideas of particular things as the
philosophers maintain, that, on the contrary, all these particular
ideas are only participations in the general idea of the infinite,
just as God does not derive his being from the creatures, but all
the creatures are imperfect participations of the divine Being.&rdquo;<a name="fa17d" id="fa17d" href="#ft17d"><span class="sp">17</span></a>
Again, he tells us, in the same chapter, that &ldquo;when we wish to
think of any particular thing, we first cast our view upon all
being, and then apply it to the consideration of the object in
question. We could not desire to see any particular object unless
we saw it already in a confused and general way, and as there is
nothing which we cannot desire to see, so all objects must be in
a manner present to our spirit.&rdquo; Or, as he puts it in another
place, &ldquo;our mind would not be capable of representing to itself
the general ideas of genera and species if it did not see all things
as contained in one; for every creature being an individual
we cannot say that we are apprehending any created thing
when we think the general idea of a triangle.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The main idea that is expressed in all these different ways is
simply this, that to determine any individual object as such, we
must relate it to, and distinguish it from, the whole of which
it is a part; and that, therefore, thought could never
<span class="sidenote">Relation of the Divine mind to human knowledge.</span>
apprehend anything if it did not bring with itself the
idea of the intelligible world as a unity. Descartes had
already expressed this truth in his <i>Meditations</i>, but
he had deprived it of its full significance by making a
distinction between the being and the idea of God, the
former of which, in his view, was only the cause of the
latter. Malebranche detects this error, and denies that there is any
idea of the infinite, which is a somewhat crude way of saying that
there is no division between the idea of the infinite and its reality.
What Reid asserted of the external world, that it is not represented
by an idea in our minds, but is actually present to them, Malebranche
asserted of God. No individual thing, he tells us&mdash;and an idea is
but an individual thing&mdash;could represent the infinite. On the
contrary, all individual things are represented through the infinite
Being, who contains them all in his substance &ldquo;très efficace, et par
conséquence très intelligible.&rdquo;<a name="fa18d" id="fa18d" href="#ft18d"><span class="sp">18</span></a> We know God by himself, material
things only by their ideas in God, for they are &ldquo;unintelligible in
themselves, and we can see them only in the being who contains
them in an intelligible manner.&rdquo; And thus, unless we in some way
&ldquo;saw God, we should be able to see nothing else.&rdquo; The vision <i>of</i>
God or <i>in</i> God, therefore, is an &ldquo;intellectual intuition&rdquo; in which
seer and seen, knower and known, are one. Our knowledge of things
is our participation in God&rsquo;s knowledge of them.</p>

<p>When we have gone so far with Malebranche, we are tempted to
ask why he does not follow out his thought to its natural conclusion.
If the idea of God is not separable from his existence, if it is through
the idea of him that all things are known, and through his existence
that all things are, then it would seem necessarily to follow that our
consciousness of God is but a part of God&rsquo;s consciousness of himself,
that our consciousness of self and other things is but God&rsquo;s consciousness
of them, and lastly, that there is no existence either of ourselves
or other things except in this consciousness. To understand Malebranche
is mainly to understand how he stopped short of results
that seemed to lie so directly in the line of his thought.</p>

<p>To begin with the last point, it is easy to see that Malebranche
only asserts unity of idea and reality in God, to deny it everywhere
else, which with him is equivalent to asserting it in general and
denying it in particular. To him, as to Descartes, the opposition
between mind and matter is absolute. Material things cannot come
into our minds nor can our minds go out of themselves &ldquo;pour se
promener dans les cieux.&rdquo;<a name="fa19d" id="fa19d" href="#ft19d"><span class="sp">19</span></a> Hence they are in themselves absolutely
unknown; they are known only in God, in whom are their ideas,
and as these ideas again are quite distinct from the reality, they
&ldquo;might be presented to the mind without anything existing.&rdquo; That
they exist <i>out</i> of God in another manner than the intelligible manner
of their existence <i>in</i> God, is explained by a mere act of His will,
that is, it is not explained at all. Though we see all things in God,
therefore, there is no connexion between his existence and theirs.
The &ldquo;world is not a necessary emanation of divinity; God is
perfectly self-sufficient, and the idea of the infinitely perfect Being
can be conceived quite apart from any other. The existence of the
creatures is due to the free decrees of God.&rdquo;<a name="fa20d" id="fa20d" href="#ft20d"><span class="sp">20</span></a> Malebranche, therefore,
still treats of external things as &ldquo;things in themselves,&rdquo; which have
an existence apart from thought, even the divine thought, though
it is only in and through the divine thought they can be known by us.
&ldquo;To see the material world, or rather to judge that it exists (since
in itself it is invisible), it is necessary that God should reveal it to
us, for we cannot see the result of his arbitrary will through necessary
reason.&rdquo;<a name="fa21d" id="fa21d" href="#ft21d"><span class="sp">21</span></a></p>

<p>But if we know external things only through their idea in God,
how do we know ourselves? Is it also through the idea of us in
God? Here we come upon a point in which Malebranche diverges
very far from his master. We do not, he says, properly <i>know</i>
ourselves at all as we know God or even external objects. We are
conscious of ourselves by inner sense (<i>sentiment interieur</i>), and from
this we know <i>that</i> we are, but we do not know <i>what</i> we are. &ldquo;We
know the existence of our soul more distinctly than of our body,
but we have not so perfect a knowledge of our soul as of our body.&rdquo;
This is shown by the fact that from our idea of body as extended
substance, we can at once see what are its possible modifications.
In other words, we only need the idea of extended substance to see
that there is an inexhaustible number of figures and motions of
which it is capable. The whole of geometry is but a development
of what is given already in the conception of extension. But it is
not so with our consciousness of self, which does not enable us to
say prior to actual experience what sensations or passions are
possible to us. We only know what heat, cold, light, colour, hunger,
anger and desire are by feeling them. Our knowledge extends as
far as our experience and no further. Nay, we have good reason to
believe that many of these modifications exist in our soul only by
reason of its accidental association with a body, and that if it were
freed from that body it would be capable of far other and higher experiences.
&ldquo;We know by feeling that our soul is great, but perhaps
we know almost nothing of what it is in itself.&rdquo; The informations
of sense have, as Descartes taught, only a practical but no theoretical
value; they tell us nothing of the external world, the real nature
of which We know not through touch and taste and sight, but only
through our idea of extended substances; while of the nature of
the soul they do not tell us much more than that it exists and that
it is not material. And in this latter case we have no idea, nothing
better than sense to raise us above its illusions. It is clear from
these statements that by self-consciousness Malebranche means
consciousness of desires and feelings, which belong to the individual
as such, and not consciousness of self as thinking. He begins, in
fact, where Descartes ended, and identifies the consciousness of
self as thinking, and so transcending the limits of its own particular
being, with the consciousness or idea of God. And between the
consciousness of the finite in sense and the consciousness of the
infinite in thought, or in other words, between the consciousness of
the universal and the consciousness of the individual, he sees no
connexion. Malebranche is just one step from the pantheistic
conclusion that the consciousness of finite individuality as such is
illusory, and that as all bodies are but modes of one infinite extension,
so all souls are but modes of one infinite thought. But while he
willingly accepts this result in regard to matter, his religious feelings
prevent him from accepting it in relation to mind. He is driven,
therefore, to the inconsistency of holding that sense and feeling,
through which in his view we apprehend the finite as such, give us
true though imperfect knowledge of the soul, while the knowledge
they give us of body is not only imperfect but false.<a name="fa22d" id="fa22d" href="#ft22d"><span class="sp">22</span></a> Thus the finite
spirit is still allowed to be a substance, distinct from the infinite,
though it holds its substantial existence on a precarious tenure. It
is left hanging, we may say, on the verge of the infinite, whose
attraction must soon prove too strong for it. Ideas are living things,
and often remould the minds that admit them in spite of the greatest
resistance of dead custom and traditionary belief. In the grasp of a
logic that overpowers him the more easily in that he is unconscious
of its tendency. Malebranche is brought within one step of the pantheistic
conclusion, and all his Christian feeling and priestly training
can do is <i>just</i> to save him from denial of the personality of man.</p>

<p>But even this denial is not the last word of pantheism. When the
principle that the finite is known only in relation to the infinite,
the individual only in relation to the universal, is interpreted as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page420" id="page420"></a>420</span>
meaning that the infinite and universal is complete in itself without
the finite and individual, when the finite and individual is treated
as a mere accidental existence due to the &ldquo;arbitrary will of God,&rdquo;
it ceases to be possible to conceive even God as a spirit. Did
Malebranche realize what he was saying when he declared that God
was &ldquo;being in general,&rdquo; but not any particular being? At any rate
we can see that the same logic that leads him almost to deny the
reality of finite beings, leads him also to seek the divine nature in
something more abstract and general even than thought. If we
must abstract from all relation to the finite in order to know God as
he is, is it not necessary for us also to abstract from self-consciousness,
for self-consciousness has a negative element in it that is something
definite, and therefore limited? We do not wonder, therefore, when
we find Malebranche saying that reason does not tell us that God
is a spirit, but only that he is an infinitely perfect being, and that
he must be conceived rather as a spirit than as a body simply because
spirit is more perfect than body. &ldquo;When we call God a spirit, it
is not so much to show positively what he is, as to signify that he
is not material.&rdquo; But as we ought not to give him a bodily form
like man&rsquo;s, so we ought not to think of his spirit as similar to our
own spirits, although we can conceive nothing more perfect. &ldquo;It
is necessary rather to believe that as he contains in himself the
properties of matter without being material, so he comprehends in
himself the perfections of created spirits without being a spirit as
we alone can conceive spirits, and that his true name is &lsquo;He who
is,&rsquo; <i>i.e.</i> Being without restriction, Being infinite and universal.&rdquo;<a name="fa23d" id="fa23d" href="#ft23d"><span class="sp">23</span></a>
Thus the essentially self-revealing God of Christianity gives way
to pure spirit, and pure spirit in its turn to the eternal and incomprehensible
substance of which we can say nothing but that it is.
The divine substance contains in it, indeed, everything that is in
creation, but it contains them <i>eminenter</i> in some incomprehensible
form that is reconcilable with its infinitude. But we have no
adequate name by which to call it except Being. The curious
metaphysic of theology by which, in his later writings, Malebranche
tried to make room for the incarnation by supposing that the finite
creation, which <i>as</i> finite is unworthy of God, was made worthy by
union with Christ, the divine Word, shows that Malebranche had
some indistinct sense of the necessity of reconciling his philosophy
with his theology; but it shows also the necessarily artificial nature
of the combination. The result of the union of such incongruous
elements was something which the theologians at once recognised as
heterodox and the philosophers as illogical.</p>

<p>There was another doctrine of Malebranche which brought him
into trouble with the theologians, and which was the main subject
of his long controversy with Arnauld. This was his denial of
particular providence. As Leibnitz maintained that this is the best
of all possible worlds, and that its evils are to be explained by the
negative nature of the finite, so Malebranche, with a slight change of
expression derived evil from the nature of particular or individual
existence. It is not conformable to the nature of God to act by any
but universal laws, and these universal laws necessarily involve
particular evil consequences, though their ultimate result is the
highest possible good. The question why there should be any
particular existence, any existence but God, seeing such existence
necessarily involves evil, remains insoluble so long as the purely
pantheistic view of God is maintained; and it is this view which is
really at the bottom of the assertion that he can have no particular
volitions. To the coarse and anthropomorphic conception of
particular providence Malebranche may be right in objecting, but
on the other hand, it cannot be doubted that any theory in which
the universal is absolutely opposed to the particular, the infinite to
the finite, is unchristian as well as unphilosophical. For under this
dualistic presupposition, there seem to be only two possible alternatives
open to thought: either the particular and finite must be
treated as something independent of the universal and infinite,
which involves an obvious contradiction, or else it must be regarded
as absolute nonentity. We find Malebranche doing the one or the
other as occasion requires. Thus he vindicates the freedom of man&rsquo;s
will on the ground that the universal will of God does not completely
determine the particular volitions of man; and then becoming
conscious of the difficulty involved in this conception, he tries, like
Descartes, to explain the particular will as something merely
negative, a defect, and not a positive existence.</p>

<p>But to understand fully Malebranche&rsquo;s view of freedom and the
ethical system connected with it, we must notice an important
alteration which he makes in the Cartesian theory of the
relation of will and intelligence. To Descartes, as we have
<span class="sidenote">Reason and will.</span>seen, the ultimate essence of mind lay in pure abstract
self-determination or will, and hence he based even moral and intellectual
truth on the arbitrary decrees of God. With Malebranche,
on the other hand, abstraction goes a step further; and the absolute
is sought not in the subject as opposed to the object, not in pure
formal self-determination as opposed to that which is determined,
but in a unity that transcends this difference. With him, therefore,
will ceases to be regarded as the essence of intelligence, and sinks
into a property or separable attribute of it. As we can conceive an
extended substance without actual movement, so, he says, we can
conceive a thinking substance without actual volition. But &ldquo;matter
or extension without motion would be entirely useless and incapable
of that variety of forms for which it is made; and we cannot, therefore,
suppose, that an all-wise Being would create it in this way.
In like manner, if a spiritual or thinking substance were without
will, it is clear that it would be quite useless, for it would not be
attracted towards the objects of its perception, and would not love
the good for which it is made. We cannot therefore conceive an
intelligent being so to fashion it.&rdquo;<a name="fa24d" id="fa24d" href="#ft24d"><span class="sp">24</span></a> Now God need not be conceived
as creating at all, for he is self-sufficient; but if he be a creator
of spirits, he must create them for himself. &ldquo;God cannot will that
there should exist a spirit that does not love him, or that loves him
less than any other good.&rdquo;<a name="fa25d" id="fa25d" href="#ft25d"><span class="sp">25</span></a> The craving for good in general, for an
absolute satisfaction, is a <i>natural</i> love of God that is common to all.
&ldquo;The just, the wicked, the blessed, and the damned all alike love
God with this love.&rdquo; Out of this love of God arises the love we
have to ourselves and to others, which are the <i>natural inclinations</i>
that belong to all created spirits. For these inclinations are but the
elements of the love which is in God, and which therefore he inspires
in all his creatures. &ldquo;Il s&rsquo;aime, il nous aime, il aime toutes ses
créatures; il ne fait donc point d&rsquo;esprits qu&rsquo;il ne les porte à l&rsquo;aimer,
à s&rsquo;aimer, et à aimer toutes les créatures.&rdquo;<a name="fa26d" id="fa26d" href="#ft26d"><span class="sp">26</span></a> Stripping this thought
of its theological vesture, what is expressed here is simply that as a
spiritual being each man is conscious of his own limited and individual
existence, as well as of the limited and individual existence
of other beings like himself, only in relation to the whole in which
they are parts, so he can find his own good only in the good of the
whole, and he is in contradiction with himself so long as he rests
in any good short of that. His love of happiness, his natural
inclinations both selfish and social, may be therefore regarded as an
undeveloped form of the love of God; and the ideal state of his
inclinations is that in which the love of self and of others are explicitly
referred to that higher affection, or in which his love does
not proceed from a part to the whole, but from the whole to the parts.</p>

<p>The question of morals to Malebranche is the question how these
<i>natural inclinations</i> are related to the particular passions. Sensation
and passion arise out of the connexion of body and soul,
and their use is only to urge us to attend to the wants of
<span class="sidenote">Ethics.</span>
the former. We can scarcely hear without a smile the simple
monastic legend which Malebranche weaves together about the
original nature of the passions and their alteration by the Fall.
&ldquo;It is visibly a disorder that a spirit capable of knowing and loving
God should be obliged to occupy itself with the needs of the body.&rdquo;
&ldquo;A being altogether occupied with what passes in his body and
with the infinity of objects that surround it cannot be thinking
on the things that are truly good.&rdquo;<a name="fa27d" id="fa27d" href="#ft27d"><span class="sp">27</span></a> Hence the necessity of an
immediate and instinctive warning from the senses in regard to
the relations of things to our organism, and also of pains and pleasures
which may induce us to attend to this warning. &ldquo;Sensible pleasure
is the mark that nature has attached to the use of certain things in
order that without having the trouble of examining them by reason,
we may employ them for the preservation of the body, but not in
order that we may love them.&rdquo;<a name="fa28d" id="fa28d" href="#ft28d"><span class="sp">28</span></a> Till the Fall the mind was merely
united to the body, not subjected to it, and the influence of these
pleasures and pains was only such as to make men attend to their
bodily wants, but not to occupy the mind, or fill it with sensuous
joys and sorrows, or trouble its contemplation of that which is really
good. Our moral aim should therefore be to restore this state of
things, to weaken our union with the body and strengthen our union
with God. And to encourage us in pursuing this aim we have to
remember that union with God is natural to the spirit, and that,
while even the condition of union with the body is artificial, the
condition of subjection to the body is wholly unnatural to it. Our
primary tendency is towards the supreme good, and we only love
the objects of our passions in so far as we &ldquo;determine towards
particular, and therefore false goods, the love that God gives us for
himself.&rdquo; The search for happiness is really the search for God in
disguise, and even the levity and inconstancy with which men rush
from one finite good to another, is a proof that they were made for
the infinite. Furthermore, this natural love of God, or inclination
for good in general, &ldquo;gives us the power of suspending our consent
in regard to those particular goods which do not satisfy it.&rdquo;<a name="fa29d" id="fa29d" href="#ft29d"><span class="sp">29</span></a> If we
refuse to be led by the obscure and confused voice of instinctive
feeling, which arises from and always tends to confirm our union
with the body, and wait for the light of reason which arises from
and always tends to confirm our union with God, we have done all
that is in our power, the rest is God&rsquo;s work. &ldquo;If we only judge
precisely of that which we see clearly, we shall never be deceived.
For then it will not be we that judge, but the universal reason that
judges in us.&rdquo;<a name="fa30d" id="fa30d" href="#ft30d"><span class="sp">30</span></a> And as our love, even of particular goods, is a
confused love of the supreme good, so the clear vision of God inevitably
brings with it the love of him. &ldquo;We needs must love the
highest when we see it.&rdquo; When it is the divine reason that speaks
in us it is the divine love that moves us, &ldquo;the same love wherewith
God loves himself and the things he has made.&rdquo;<a name="fa31d" id="fa31d" href="#ft31d"><span class="sp">31</span></a></p>

<p>The general result of the ethics of Malebranche is ascetic. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page421" id="page421"></a>421</span>
passions, like the senses, have no relation to the higher life of the
soul; their value is only in relation to the union of soul and body, a
union which is purely accidental or due to the arbitrary will of God.
The more silently they discharge their provisional function, and the
less they disturb or interfere with the pure activity of spirit,
the more nearly they approach to the only perfection that is possible
for them. Their ideal state is to remain or become again simple
instincts that act mechanically like the circulation of the blood.
Universal light of reason casts no ray into the obscurity of sense;
its universal love cannot embrace any of the objects of particular
passion. It is indeed recognized by Malebranche that sensation in
man is mixed with thought, that the passions in him are forms of the
love of good in general. But this union of the rational with the
sensuous nature is regarded merely as a confusion which is to be
cleared up, <i>not</i> in a higher unity of the two elements, but simply by
the withdrawal of the spirit from contact with that which darkens and
defiles it. Of a transformation of sense into thought, of passion into
duty&mdash;an elevation of the life of sense till it becomes the embodiment
and expression of the life of reason&mdash;Malebranche has no conception.
Hence the life of reason turns with him to mysticism in theory
and to asceticism in practice. His universal is abstract and opposed
to the particular; instead of explaining it, it explains it away.</p>

<p>A certain tender beauty as of twilight is spread over the world
as we view it through the eyes of this cloistered philosopher, and we
do not at first see that the softness and ideality of the picture is
due to the gathering darkness. Abstraction seems only to be purifying,
and not destroying, till it has done its perfect work. Malebranche
conceived himself to be presenting to the world only the
purest and most refined expression of Christian ethics and theology.
But if we obey his own continual advice to think clearly and distinctly,
if we divest his system of all the sensuous and imaginative
forms in which he has clothed it, and reduce it to the naked simplicity
of its central thought, what we find is not a God that reveals himself
in the finite, and to the finite, but the absolute substance which has
no revelation, and whose existence is the negation of all but itself.
Thus to tear away the veil, however, there was needed a stronger,
simpler, and freer spirit&mdash;a spirit less influenced by opinion, less
inclined to practical compromise, and gifted with a stronger &ldquo;faith
in the whispers of the lonely muse&rdquo; of speculation than Malebranche.</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Philosophy of Spinoza.</i>&mdash;It is a remark of Hegel&rsquo;s that
Spinoza, as a Jew, first brought into European thought the idea
of an absolute unity in which the difference of finite and infinite
is lost. Some later writers have gone further, and attempted to
show that the main doctrines by which his philosophy is distinguished
from that of Descartes were due to the direct influences
of Jewish writers like Maimonides, Gersonides, and Hasdai
Crescas, rather than to the necessary development of Cartesian
ideas. And it is undoubtedly true that many points of similarity
with such writers, reaching down even to verbal coincidence,
may be detected in the works of Spinoza, although it is not so
easy to determine how much he owed to their teaching. His own
view of his obligations is sufficiently indicated by the fact, that
while in his ethics he carries on a continual polemic against
Descartes, and strives at every point to show that his own
doctrines are legitimately derived from Cartesian principles,
he only once refers to Jewish philosophy as containing an
obscure and unreasoned anticipation of these doctrines. &ldquo;Quod
quidam Hebraeorum quasi per nebulam vidisse videntur qui
scilicet statuunt Deum Dei intellectum resque ab ipso intellectas
unum et idem esse.&rdquo;<a name="fa32d" id="fa32d" href="#ft32d"><span class="sp">32</span></a> It may be that the undeveloped pantheism
and rationalism of the Jewish philosophers had a deeper influence
than he himself was aware of, in emancipating him from the
traditions of the synagogue, and giving to his mind its first
philosophical bias. In his earlier work there are Neoplatonic
ideas and expressions which in the <i>Ethics</i> are rejected or remoulded
into a form more suitable to the spirit of Cartesianism.
But the question, after all, has little more than a biographical
interest. In the Spinozistic philosophy there are few differences
from Descartes which cannot be traced to the necessary development
of Cartesian principles; and the comparison of Malebranche
shows that a similar development might take place under the
most diverse intellectual conditions. What is most remarkable
in Spinoza is just the freedom and security with which these principles
are followed out to their last result. His Jewish origin and
his breach with Judaism completely isolated him from every
influence but that of the thought that possesses him. And no
scruple or hesitation, no respect for the institutions or feelings
of his time interferes with his speculative consequence. He
exhibits to us the almost perfect type of a mind without superstitions,
which has freed itself from all but reasoned and intelligent
convictions, or, in the Cartesian phrase, &ldquo;clear and distinct
ideas&rdquo;; and when he fails, it is not by any inconsistency, or
arbitrary stopping short of the necessary conclusions of his
logic, but by the essential defect of his principles.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Spinoza takes his idea of method from mathematics, and after
the manner of Euclid, places at the head of each book of his <i>Ethics</i>
a certain number of definitions, axioms, and postulates
which are supposed to be intuitively certain, and to form
<span class="sidenote">Geometrical method applied to metaphysics.</span>
a sufficient basis for all that follows. Altogether there
are twenty-seven definitions, twenty axioms, and eight
postulates. If Spinoza is regarded as the most consequent
of philosophers it cannot be because he has based his
system upon so many fragmentary views of truth; it
must be because a deeper unity has been discerned in the system
than is visible on the first aspect of it. We must, therefore, to a
certain extent distinguish between the form and the matter of his
thought, though it is also true that the defective form itself involves
a defect in the matter.</p>

<p>What in the first instance recommends the geometrical method to
Spinoza is, not only its apparent exactness and the necessity of its
sequence, but, so to speak, its disinterestedness. Confusion of
thought arises from the fact that we put ourselves, our desires and
feelings and interests, into our view of things; that we do not regard
them as they are in themselves, in their essential nature, but look
for some final cause, that is, some relation to ourselves by which
they may be explained. For this reason, he says, &ldquo;the truth might
for ever have remained hid from the human race, if mathematics,
which looks not to the final cause of figures, but to their essential
nature and the properties involved in it, had not set another type of
knowledge before them.&rdquo; To understand things is to see how all
that is true of them flows from the clear and distinct idea expressed
in their definition, and ultimately, it is to see how all truth flows
from the <i>essentia Dei</i> as all geometrical truth flows from the idea of
quantity. To take a mathematical view of the universe, therefore,
is to raise ourselves above all consideration of the end or tendency
of things, above the fears and hopes of mortality into the region
of truth and necessity. &ldquo;When I turned my mind to this subject,&rdquo;
he says in the beginning of his treatise on politics, &ldquo;I did not propose
to myself any novel or strange aim, but simply to demonstrate by
certain and indubitable reason those things which agree best with
practice. And in order that I might inquire into the matters of
this science with the same freedom of mind with which we are wont
to treat lines and surfaces in mathematics, I determined not to
laugh or to weep over the actions of men, but simply to understand
them; and to contemplate their affections and passions, such as love,
hate, anger, envy, arrogance, pity and all other disturbances of soul
not as vices of human nature, but as properties pertaining to it in
the same way as heat, cold, storm, thunder pertain to the nature of
the atmosphere. For these, though troublesome, are yet necessary,
and have certain causes through which we may come to understand
them, and thus, by contemplating them in their truth, gain for our
minds as much joy as by the knowledge of things that are pleasing
to the senses.&rdquo; All our errors as to the nature of things arise from
our judging them from the point of view of the part and not of the
whole, from appoint of view determined by their relation to our own
individual being, and not from a point of view determined by the
nature of the things themselves; or, to put the same thing in another
way, from the point of view of sense and imagination, and not from
the point of view of intelligence. Mathematics shows us the inadequacy
of such knowledge when it takes us out of ourselves into
things, and when it presents these things to us as objects of universal
intelligence apart from all special relation to our individual feelings.
And Spinoza only wishes that the same universality and freedom of
thought which belongs to mathematics, because its objects <i>do not</i>
interest the passions, should be extended to those objects that <i>do</i>
interest them. Purity from interest is the first condition of the
philosopher&rsquo;s being; he must get beyond the illusion of sense and
passion that makes our own lives so supremely important and
interesting to us simply because they are our own. He must look
at the present as it were through an inverted telescope of reason,
that will reduce it to its due proportion and place in the sum of
things. To the heat of passion and the higher heat of imagination,
Spinoza has only one advice&mdash;&ldquo;Acquaint yourself with God and
be at peace.&rdquo; Look not to the particular but to the universal, view
things not under the form of the finite and temporal, but <i>sub quadam
specie aeternitatis.</i></p>

<p>The illusion of the finite&mdash;the illusion of sense, imagination and
passion, which, in Bacon&rsquo;s language, tends to make men judge of
things <i>ex analogia hominis</i> and not <i>ex analogia universi</i>,
which raises the individual life, and even the present
<span class="sidenote">Sense the source of error.</span>
moment of the individual life, with its passing feelings,
into the standard for measuring the universe&mdash;this, in
the eyes of Spinoza, is the source of all error and evil to man.
On  the  other  hand, his  highest  good  is  to  live  the  universal
life of reason, or what is the same thing, to view all things from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page422" id="page422"></a>422</span>
their centre in God, and to be moved only by the passion for good in
general, &ldquo;the intellectual love of God.&rdquo; In the treatise <i>De Emendatione
Intellectus</i>, Spinoza takes up this contrast in the first instance
from its moral side. &ldquo;All our felicity or infelicity is founded on the
nature of the object to which we are joined by love.&rdquo; To love the
things that perish is to be in continual trouble and disturbance of
passion; it is to be full of envy and hatred towards others who
possess them; it is to be ever striving after that which, when we
attain it, does not satisfy us; or lamenting over the loss of that
which inevitably passes away from us; only &ldquo;love to an object
that is infinite and eternal feeds the soul with a changeless and
unmingled joy.&rdquo; But again our love rests upon our knowledge;
if we saw things as they really are we should love only the highest
object. It is because sense and imagination give to the finite an
independence and substantiality that do not belong to it, that we
waste our love upon it as if it were infinite. And as the first step
towards truth is to understand our error, so Spinoza proceeds to
explain the defects of common sense, or in other words, of that first
and unreflected view of the world which he, like Plato, calls opinion.
Opinion is a kind of knowledge derived partly from hearsay, and
partly from <i>experientia vaga</i>. It consists of vague and general conceptions
of things, got either from the report of others or from an
experience which has not received any special direction from intelligence.
The mind that has not got beyond the stage of opinion
takes things as they present themselves in its individual experience;
and its beliefs grow up by association of whatever happens to have
been found together in that experience. And as the combining
principle of the elements of opinion is individual and not universal,
so its conception of the world is at once fragmentary and accidental.
It does not see things in their connexion with the unity of the whole,
and hence it cannot see them in their true relation to each other.
&ldquo;I assert expressly,&rdquo; says Spinoza, &ldquo;that the mind has no adequate
conception either of itself or of external things, but only a confused
knowledge of them, so long as it perceives them only in the common
order of nature, <i>i.e.</i> so long as it is <i>externally determined</i> to contemplate
this or that object by the accidental concourse of things, and
so long as it is not <i>internally</i> determined by the unity of thought in
which it considers a number of things to understand their agreements,
differences and contradictions.&rdquo;<a name="fa33d" id="fa33d" href="#ft33d"><span class="sp">33</span></a></p>

<p>There are two kinds of errors which are usually supposed to
exclude each other, but which Spinoza finds to be united in opinion.
These are the errors of abstraction and imagination;
the former explains its vice by defect, the latter its vice
<span class="sidenote">Vices of abstraction and imagination.</span>
by excess. On the one hand, opinion is abstract and one-sided;
it is defective in knowledge and takes hold of
things only at one point. On the other hand, and just
because of this abstractness and one-sidedness, it is forced
to give an artificial completeness and independence to that which is
essentially fragmentary and dependent. The word &ldquo;abstract&rdquo; is
misleading, in so far as we are wont to associate with abstraction the
idea of a mental effort by which parts are separated from a given
whole; but it may be applied without violence to any imperfect
conception, in which things that are really elements of a greater
whole are treated as if they were <i>res completae</i>, independent objects,
complete in themselves. And in this sense the ordinary consciousness
of man is often the victim of abstractions when it supposes itself
most of all to be dealing with realities. The essences and substances
of the schoolman may delude him, but he cannot think these notions
clearly without seeing that they are only abstract elements of reality,
and that they have a meaning only in relation to the other elements
of it. But common sense remains unconscious of its abstractness
because imagination gives a kind of substantiality to the fragmentary
and limited, and so makes it possible to conceive it as an independent
reality. Pure intelligence seeing the part as it is in itself could never
see it but as a part. Thought, when it rises to clearness and distinctness
in regard to any finite object, must at once discern its relation
to other finite objects and to the whole,&mdash;must discern, in Spinozistic
language, that it is &ldquo;modal&rdquo; and not &ldquo;real.&rdquo; But though it is
not possible to <i>think</i> the part as a whole it is possible to picture it
as a whole. The limited image that fills the mind&rsquo;s eye seems to
need nothing else for its reality. We cannot think a house clearly
and distinctly in all the connexion of its parts with each other
without seeing its necessary relation to the earth on which it stands,
to the pressure of the atmosphere, &amp;c. The very circumstances by
which the possibility of such an existence is explained make it impossible
to conceive it apart from other things. But nothing hinders
me from resting on a house as a complete picture by itself. Imagination
represents things in the externality of space and time, and is
subjected to no other conditions but those of space and time. Hence
it can begin anywhere and stop anywhere. For the same cause it
can mingle and confuse together all manner of inconsistent forms&mdash;can
imagine a man with a horse&rsquo;s head, a candle blazing in vacuo, a
speaking tree, a man changed into an animal. There may be elements
in the nature of these things that would prevent such combinations;
but these elements are not necessarily present to the
ordinary consciousness, the abstractness of whose conceptions leaves
it absolutely at the mercy of imagination or accidental association.
To thought in this stage anything is possible that can be pictured.
On the other hand, as knowledge advances, this freedom of combination
becomes limited, &ldquo;the less the mind understands and the
more it perceives the greater is its power of fiction, and the more it
understands the narrower is the limitation of that power. For
just as in the moment of consciousness we cannot imagine that we
do not think, so after we have apprehended the nature of body we
cannot conceive of a fly of infinite size, and after we know the nature
of a soul we cannot think of it as a square, though we may use the
words that express these ideas.&rdquo;<a name="fa34d" id="fa34d" href="#ft34d"><span class="sp">34</span></a> Thus, according to Spinoza,
the range of possibility narrows as knowledge widens, until to
perfected knowledge posibility is lost in necessity.</p>

<p>From these considerations it follows that all thought is imperfect
that stops short of the absolute unity of all things. Our first imperfect
notion of things as isolated from each other, or
connected only by co-existence and succession, is a mere
<span class="sidenote">Insufficiency of the individual.</span>
imagination of things. It is a fictitious substantiation
of isolated moments in the eternal Being. Knowledge,
so far as it deals with the finite, is engaged in a continual
process of self-correction which can never be completed, for at every
step there is an element of falsity, in so far as the mind rests in the
contemplation of a certain number of the elements of the world,
as if they constituted a complete whole by themselves, whereas
they are only a part, the conception of which has to be modified
at the next step of considering its relation to the other parts. Thus
we rise from individuals of the first to individuals of the second order,
and we cannot stop short of the idea of &ldquo;all nature as one individual
whose parts vary through an infinite number of modes, without
change of the whole individual.&rdquo;<a name="fa35d" id="fa35d" href="#ft35d"><span class="sp">35</span></a> At first we think of pieces of
matter as independent individuals, either because we can picture
them separately, or because they preserve a certain proportion or
relation of parts through their changes. But on further consideration,
these apparent substances sink into modes, each of which is
dependent on all the others. All nature is bound together by
necessary law, and not an atom could be other than it is without
the change of the whole world. Hence it is only in the whole world
that there is any true individuality or substance. And the same
principle applies to the minds of men. Their individuality is a mere
semblance caused by our abstraction from their conditions. Isolate
the individual man, and he will not display the character of a thinking
being at all. His whole spiritual life is bound up with his relations
to other minds, past and present. He has such a life, only in
and through that universal life of which he is so infinitesimal a part
that his own contribution to it is as good as nothing. &ldquo;Vis qua
homo in existendo perseverat limitata est, et a potentia causarum
externarum infinite superatur.&rdquo;<a name="fa36d" id="fa36d" href="#ft36d"><span class="sp">36</span></a> What can be called his own?
His body is a link in a cyclical chain of movement which involves
all the matter of the world, and which as a whole remains without
change through all. His mind is a link in a great movement of
thought, which makes him the momentary organ and expression of
one of its phases. His very consciousness of self is marred by a false
abstraction, above which he must rise ere he can know himself as he
really is.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us imagine,&rdquo; says Spinoza in his fifteenth letter, &ldquo;a little
worm living in blood which has vision enough to discern the particles
of blood, lymph, &amp;c., and reason enough to observe how one particle
is repelled by another with which it comes into contact, or communicates
a part of its motion to it. Such a worm would live in the
blood as we do in this part of the universe, and would regard each
particle of it, not as a part, but as a whole, nor could it know how
all the parts are influenced by the universal nature of the blood, and
are obliged to accommodate themselves to each other as is required
by that nature, so that they co-operate together according to a fixed
law. For if we suppose that there are no causes outside of the blood
which could communicate new motions to it, and no space beyond
the blood, nor any other bodies to which its particles could transfer
their motion, it is certain that the blood as a whole would always
maintain its present state, and its particles would suffer no other
variations than those which may be inferred from the given relation
of the motion of the blood to lymph, chyle, &amp;c. And thus in that
case the blood would require to be considered always as a whole and
not as a part. But since there are many other causes which influence
the laws of the nature of blood, and are in turn influenced thereby,
other motions and other variations must arise in the blood which are
not due to the proportion of motion in its constituents but also to
the relation between that motion and external causes. And therefore
we cannot consider the blood as a whole, but only as a part of
a greater whole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we can think, and indeed ought to think, of all natural
bodies in the same manner in which we have thought of this blood,
for all bodies are surrounded by other bodies, and reciprocally
determine and are determined by them, to exist and operate in a
fixed and definite way, so as to preserve the same ratio of motion
and rest in the whole universe. Hence it follows that every body,
in so far as it exists under a certain definite modification, ought to
be considered as merely a part of the whole universe which agrees
with its whole, and thereby is in intimate union with all the other
parts; and since the nature of the universe is not limited like that
of the blood, but absolutely infinite, it is clear that by this nature,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page423" id="page423"></a>423</span>
with its infinite powers, the parts are modified in an infinite number
of ways, and compelled to pass through an infinity of variations.
Moreover, when I think of the universe as a substance, I conceive
of a still closer union of each part with the whole; for, as I have
elsewhere shown, it is the nature of substance to be infinite, and
therefore every single part belongs to the nature of the corporeal
substance, so that apart therefrom it neither can exist nor be conceived.
And as to the human mind, I think of it also as of part of
nature, for I think of nature as having in it an infinite power of
thinking, which, as infinite, contains in itself the idea of all nature,
and whose thoughts run parallel with all existence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From this point of view it is obvious that our knowledge of things
cannot be real and adequate, except in so far as it is determined by
the idea of the whole, and proceeds from the whole to the
parts. A knowledge that proceeds from part to part
<span class="sidenote">The whole dominates the parts.</span>
must always be imperfect; it must remain external to
its object, it must deal in abstractions or mere <i>entia
rationis</i>, which it may easily be led to mistake for realities. Hence
Spinoza, like Plato, distinguishes reason whose movement is regressive
(from effect to cause, from variety to unity) from <i>scientia
intuitiva</i>, whose movement is progressive, which &ldquo;proceeds from
the adequate idea of certain of God&rsquo;s attributes to an adequate
knowledge of the nature of things.&rdquo;<a name="fa37d" id="fa37d" href="#ft37d"><span class="sp">37</span></a> The latter alone deserves to
be called science in the highest sense of the term. &ldquo;For in order that
our mind may correspond to the exemplar of nature, it must develop
all its ideas from the idea that represents the origin and source of
nature, so that that idea may appear as the source of all other
ideas.&rdquo;<a name="fa38d" id="fa38d" href="#ft38d"><span class="sp">38</span></a> The regressive mode of knowledge has its highest value in
preparing for the progressive. The knowledge of the finite, ere it
can become perfectly adequate, must be absorbed and lost in the
knowledge of the infinite.</p>

<p>In a remarkable passage in the <i>Ethics</i>, Spinoza declares that the
defect of the common consciousness of men lies not so much in their
ignorance, either of the infinite or of the finite, as in their
incapacity for bringing the two thoughts together, so as
<span class="sidenote">Finite things modes of infinite substance.</span>
to put the latter in its proper relation to the former.
All are ready to confess that God is the cause both of the
existence and of the nature of things created, but they
do not realize what is involved in this confession&mdash;and
hence they treat created things as if they were substances, that is,
as if they were Gods. &ldquo;Thus while they are contemplating finite
things, they think of nothing less than of the divine nature; and
again when they turn to consider the divine nature, they think of
nothing less than of their former fictions on which they have built
up the knowledge of finite things, as if these things could contribute
nothing to our understanding of the divine nature. Hence it is not
wonderful that they are always contradicting themselves.&rdquo;<a name="fa39d" id="fa39d" href="#ft39d"><span class="sp">39</span></a> As
Spinoza says elsewhere, it belongs to the very nature of the human
mind to know God, for unless we know God we could know nothing
else. The idea of the absolute unity is involved in the idea of every
particular thing, yet the generality of men, deluded by sense and
imagination, are unable to bring this implication into clear consciousness,
and hence their knowledge of God does not modify their view
of the finite. It is the business of philosophy to correct this defect,
to transform our conceptions of the finite by relating it to the
infinite, to complement and complete the partial knowledge produced
by individual experience by bringing it into connexion with the idea
of the whole. And the vital question which Spinoza himself prompts
us to ask is how far and in what way this transformation is effected
in the Spinozistic philosophy.</p>

<p>There are two great steps in the transformation of knowledge by
the idea of unity as that idea is conceived by Spinoza. The first
step involves a change of the conception of individual finite things
by which they lose their individuality, their character as independent
substances, and come to be regarded as modes of the infinite. But
secondly, this negation of the finite as such is not conceived as
implying the negation of the distinction between mind and matter.
Mind and matter still retain that absolute opposition which they
had in the philosophy of Descartes, even after all limits have been
removed. And therefore in order to reach the absolute unity, and
transcend the Cartesian dualism, a second step is necessary, by
which the independent substantiality of mind and matter is withdrawn,
and they are reduced into attributes of the one infinite
substance. Let us examine these steps successively.</p>

<p>The method by which the finite is reduced into a mode of the
infinite has already been partially explained. Spinoza follows to its
legitimate result the metaphysical or logical principles of
Descartes and Malebranche. According to the former,
<span class="sidenote">Application to nature of matter.</span>
as we nave seen, the finite presupposes the infinite, and,
indeed, so far as it is real, it is identical with the infinite.
The infinite is absolute reality, because it is pure affirmation,
because it is that which <i>negationem nullam involvit</i>. The finite
is distinguished from it simply by its limit, <i>i.e.</i> by its wanting something
which the infinite has. At this point Spinoza takes up the
argument. If the infinite be the real, and the finite, so far as it is
distinguished therefrom, the unreal, then the supposed substantiality
or individuality of finite beings is an illusion. In itself the finite is
but an abstraction, to which imagination has given an apparent
independence. All limitation or determination is negative, and in
order to apprehend positive reality we must abstract from limits.
By denying the negative, we reach the affirmative; by annihilating
finitude in our thought, and so undoing the illusory work of the
imagination, we reach the indeterminate or unconditioned being
which alone truly is. All division, distinction and relation are but
<i>entia rationis.</i> Imagination and abstraction can give to them, as
they can give to mere negation and nothingness, &ldquo;a local habitation
and a name,&rdquo; but they have no objective meaning, and in the highest
knowledge, in the <i>scientia intuitiva</i>, which deals only with reality,
they must entirely disappear. Hence to reach the truth as to matter,
we must free ourselves from all such ideas as figure or number,
measure or time, which imply the separation and relation of parts.
Thus in his 50th letter, in answer to some question about figure,
Spinoza says, &ldquo;to prove that figure is negation, and not anything
positive, we need only consider that the whole of matter conceived
indefinitely, or in its infinity, can have no figure; but that figure
has a place only in finite or determinate bodies. He who says that
he perceives figure, says only that he has before his mind a limited
thing and the manner in which it is limited. But this limitation
does not pertain to a thing in its &lsquo;esse,&rsquo; but contrariwise in its
&rsquo;non-esse&rsquo; (<i>i.e.</i> it signifies, not that some positive quality belongs
to the thing, but that something is wanting to it). Since, then,
figure is but limitation, and limitation is but negation, we cannot
say that figure is anything.&rdquo; The same kind of reasoning is elsewhere
(<i>Epist.</i> 29) applied to solve the difficulties connected with the
divisibility of space or extension. Really, according to Spinoza,
extension is indivisible, though modally it is divisible. In other
words, parts <i>ad infinitum</i> may be taken in space by the abstracting
mind, but these parts have no separate existence. You cannot
rend space, or take one part of it out of its connexion with other
parts. Hence arises the impossibility of asserting either that there
is an infinite number of parts in space, or that there is not. The
solution of the antinomy is that neither alternative is true. There
are many things &ldquo;quae nullo numero explicari possunt,&rdquo; and to
understand these things we must abstract altogether from the
idea of number. The contradiction arises entirely from the application
of that idea to the infinite. We cannot say that space has a
finite number of parts, for every finite space must be conceived as
itself included in infinite space. Yet, on the other hand, an infinite
number is an absurdity; it is a number which is not a number.
We escape the difficulty only when we see that number is a category
inapplicable to the infinite, and this to Spinoza means that it is
not applicable to reality, that it is merely an abstraction, or <i>ens
imaginationis.</i></p>

<p>The same method which solves the difficulties connected with the
nature of matter is applied to mind. Here also we reach the reality,
or thing in itself, by abstracting from all determination.
All conceptions, therefore, that involve the independence
<span class="sidenote">Nature of mind.</span>
of the finite, all conceptions of good, evil, freedom and
responsibility disappear. When W. Blyenburg accuses Spinoza of
making God the author of evil, Spinoza answers that evil is an <i>ens
rationis</i> that has no existence for God. &ldquo;Evil is not something positive,
but a state of privation, and that not in relation to the divine,
but simply in relation to the human intelligence. It is a conception
that arises from that generalizing tendency of our minds, which
leads us to bring all beings that have the external form of man
under one and the same definition, and to suppose that they are all
equally capable of the highest perfection we can deduce from such a
definition. When, therefore, we find an individual whose works are
not consistent with this perfection, straightway we judge that he is
deprived of it, or that he is diverging from his own nature,&mdash;a
judgment we should never make if we had not thus referred him to
a general definition, and supposed him to be possessed of the nature
it defines. But since God does not know things abstractly, or through
such general definitions, and since there cannot be more reality
in things than the divine intelligence and power bestows upon them,
it manifestly follows that the defect which belongs to finite things,
cannot be called a privation in relation to the intelligence of God,
but only in relation to the intelligence of man.&rdquo;<a name="fa40d" id="fa40d" href="#ft40d"><span class="sp">40</span></a> Thus evil and good
vanish when we consider things <i>sub specie aeternitatis</i>, because they
are categories that imply a certain independence in finite beings.
For the idea of a moral standard implies a relation of man to the
absolute good, a relation of the finite to the infinite, in which the
finite is not simply lost and absorbed in the infinite. But Spinoza
can admit no such relation. In the presence of the infinite the finite
disappears, for it exists only by abstraction and negation; or it
<i>seems</i> to us to exist, not because of what is present to our thoughts,
but because of what is not present to them. As we think ourselves
free because we are conscious of our actions but not of their causes,
so we think that we have an individual existence only because the
infinite intelligence is not wholly but only partially realized in us.
But as we cannot really divide space, though we can think of a part
of it, so neither can we place any real division in the divine intelligence.
In this way we can understand how Spinoza is able to speak
of the human mind as part of the infinite thought of God, and of the
human body as part of the infinite extension of God, while yet he
asserts that the divine substance is simple, and not made up of parts.

So far as they exist, they must be conceived as parts of the divine
substance, but when we look directly at that divine substance their
separate existence altogether disappears.</p>

<p>It has, however, been already mentioned that this ascending
movement of abstraction does not at once and directly bring
Spinoza to the absolute unity of substance. The principle
that &ldquo;determination is negation,&rdquo; and that therefore
<span class="sidenote">Soul and body.</span>
the absolute reality is to be found only in the
indeterminate, would lead us to expect this conclusion; but the
Cartesian dualism prevents Spinoza from reaching it. Mind and
matter are so absolutely opposed, that even when we take away
all limit and determination from both, they still retain their
distinctness. Raised to infinity, they still refuse to be identified.
We are forced, indeed, to take from them their substantial or substantive
existence, for there can be no other substance but God,
who includes all reality in himself. But though reduced to attributes
of a common substance, the difference of thought and extension is
insoluble. The independence of individual finite things disappears
whenever we substitute thought for imagination, but even to pure
intelligence, extension remains extension, and thought remains
<span class="sidenote">Spinoza&rsquo;s refuge from Descartes&rsquo; dualism.</span>
thought. Spinoza seems therefore reduced to a dilemma;
he cannot surrender either the unity or the duality of
things, yet he cannot relate them to each other. The only
course left open to him is to conceive each attribute in its
turn as the whole substance, and to regard their difference
as the difference of expression. As the patriarch was
called by the two names of Jacob and Israel, under different aspects,
each of which included the whole reality of the man, so our minds
apprehend the absolute substance in two ways, each of which
expresses its whole nature.<a name="fa41d" id="fa41d" href="#ft41d"><span class="sp">41</span></a> In this way the extremes of absolute
identity and absolute difference seem to be reconciled. There is a
complete parallelism of thought and extension, &ldquo;ordo et connexio
idearum idem est ac ordo et connexio rerum,&rdquo;<a name="fa42d" id="fa42d" href="#ft42d"><span class="sp">42</span></a> yet there is also a
complete independence and absence of relation between them, for
each is the whole. A thing in one expression cannot be related to
itself in another expression. Hence in so far as we look at the
substance under the attribute of thought, we must take no account
of extension, and in so far as we look at it under the attribute of
extension, we must equally refuse to take any account of thought.
This parallelism may be best illustrated by Spinoza&rsquo;s account of the
relation of the human soul and body. The soul is the idea of the
body, and the body is the object of the soul, whatever is in the one
really is in the other ideally; yet this relation of object and subject
does not imply any connexion. The motions and changes of the
body have to be accounted for partly by itself, partly by the influence
of other bodies; and the thoughts of the soul in like manner have
to be accounted for partly by what God thinks as constituting the
individual mind, and partly by what he thinks as constituting the
minds of other individuals. But to account for thought by the
motions of the body, or for the motions of the body by thought,
is to attempt to bridge the impassable gulf between thought and
extension. It involves the double absurdity of accounting for a
thing by itself, and of accounting for it by that which has nothing
in common with it.</p>

<p>In one point of view, this theory of Spinoza deserves the highest
praise for that very characteristic which probably excited most
odium against it at the time it was first published, namely,
its exaitation of matter. It is the mark of an imperfect
<span class="sidenote">Spinoza&rsquo;s higher idealsim.</span>
spiritualism to hide its eyes from outward nature, and to
shrink from the material as impure and defiling. But
its horror and fear are proofs of weakness; it flies from an enemy
it cannot overcome. Spinoza&rsquo;s bold identification of spirit and
matter, God and nature, contains in it the germ of a higher idealism
than can be found in any philosophy that asserts the claims of the
former at the expense of the latter. A system that begins by making
nature godless, will inevitably end, as Schelling once said, in making
God unnatural. The expedients by which Descartes keeps matter at
a distance from God, were intended to maintain his pure spirituality;
but their ultimate effect was seen in his reduction of the spiritual
nature to mere will. As Christianity has its superiority over other
religions in this, that it does not end with the opposition of the human
to the divine, the natural to the spiritual, but ultimately reconciles
them, so a true idealism must vindicate its claims by absorbing
materialism into itself. It was, therefore, a true instinct of philosophy
that led Spinoza to raise matter to the co-equal of spirit, and at
the same time to protest against the Cartesian conception of matter
as mere inert mass, moved only by impulse from without. &ldquo;What
were a God that only impelled the world from without?&rdquo; says
Goethe. &ldquo;It becomes him to stir it by an inward energy, to involve
nature in himself, himself in nature, so that that which lives and
moves and has a being in him can never feel the want of his power
or his spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While, however, Spinoza thus escapes some of the inconsequences
of Descartes, the contradiction that was <i>implicit</i> in the Cartesian
system between the duality and the unity, the attributes and the
substance, in his system becomes <i>explicit</i>. When so great emphasis
is laid upon the unity of substance, it becomes more difficult to
explain the difference of the attributes. The result is, that Spinoza
is forced to account for it, not by the nature of substance itself,
but by the nature of the intelligence to which it is revealed. &ldquo;By
<span class="sidenote">Logical diffculties in Spinoza&rsquo;s metaphysics.</span>
substance,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I understand that which is in itself,
and is conceived through itself. By attribute I understand
the same thing, nisi quod attributum dicatur respectu
inteltectus substantiae certum talem naturam tribuentis.&rdquo;<a name="fa43d" id="fa43d" href="#ft43d"><span class="sp">43</span></a>
Hence we are naturally led with J.E. Erdmann to think
of the intelligence dividing the substance as a kind of
prism that breaks the white light into different colours,
through each of which the same world is seen, only with a
different aspect. But if the intelligence in itself is but a mode of
one of the attributes, how can it be itself the source of their
distinction?</p>

<p>The key to this difficulty is that Spinoza has really, and almost in
spite of his logical principles, two opposite conceptions of substance,
between which he alternates without ever bringing them to a unity.
On the one hand, in accordance with the principle that determination
is negation, substance must be taken as that which is utterly indeterminate,
like the Absolute of the Buddhist, which we can characterize
only by denying of it everything that we assert of the finite.
In this view, no predicate can be applied univocally to God and to
the creatures; he differs from them, not only in existence, but in
essence.<a name="fa44d" id="fa44d" href="#ft44d"><span class="sp">44</span></a> If we follow out this view to its legitimate result, God is
withdrawn into his own absolute unity, and no difference of attributes
can be ascribed to him, except in respect of something else than
himself. It is owing to the defects of out intelligence that he appears
under different forms or expressions; in himself he is pure being,
without form or expression at all. But, on the other hand, it is to be
observed, that while Spinoza really proceeds by abstraction and
negation, he does not <i>mean</i> to do so. The abstract is to him the
unreal and imaginary, and what he means by substance is not
simply Being in general, the conception that remains when we omit
all that distinguishes the particulars, but the absolute totality of
things conceived as a unity in which all particular existence is
included and subordinated. Hence at a single stroke the indeterminate
passes into the most determinate Being, the Being with no
attributes at all into the Being constituted by an infinite number
of attributes. And while, under the former conception, the defect
of our intelligence seemed to be that it divided the substance, or
saw a difference of attributes in its absolute unity, under the second
conception its defect lies in its apprehending only two out of the
infinite multitude of these attributes.</p>

<p>To do justice to Spinoza, therefore, we must distinguish between
the actual effect of his logic and its effect as he conceived it. The
actual effect of his logic is to dissolve all in the ultimate abstraction
of Being, from which we can find no way back to the concrete.
But his intent was simply to relate all the parts to that absolute
unity which is the presupposition of all thought and being, and so
to arrive at the most concrete and complete idea of the reality of
things. He failed to see what is involved in his own principle that
determination is negation; for if affirmation is impossible without
negation, then the attempt to divorce the two from each other, the
attempt to find a purely affirmative being, must necessarily end in
the barest of all abstractions being confused with the unity of all
things. But even when the infinite substance is defined as the
negative of the finite, the idea of the finite becomes an essential
element in the conception of the infinite. Even the Pantheist, who
says that God is what finite things are not, in spite of himself recognizes
that God has a relation to finite things. Finite things may in
his eyes have no positive relation to God, yet they have a negative
relation; it is through their evanescence and transitoriness, through
their nothingness, that the eternal, the infinite reality alone is
revealed to him. Spinoza is quite conscious of this process, conscious
that he reaches the affirmation of substance by a negation of what
he conceives as the purely negative and unreal existence of finite
things, but as he regards the assertion of the finite as merely an
illusion due to <i>our</i> imagination, so he regards the correction of this
illusion, the negation of the finite as a movement of reflection which
belongs merely to our intelligence, and has nothing to do with the
nature of substance in itself. We find the true affirmation by the
negation of the negative, but in itself affirmation has no relation
to negation. Hence his absolute being is the dead all-absorbing
substance and not the self-revealing spirit. It is the being without
determination, and not the being that determines itself. There is no
reason in the nature of substance why it should have either attributes
or modes; neither individual finite things nor the general distinction
of mind and matter can be deduced from it. The descending movement
of thought is not what Spinoza himself said it should be, an
evolution, but simply an external and empirical process by which
the elements dropped in the ascending movement of abstraction are
taken up again with a merely nominal change. For the sole difference
in the conception of mind and matter as well as in the conception
of individual minds and bodies which is made by their reference to
the idea of God, is that they lose their substantive character and
become adjectives. Aristotle objected to Plato that his ideas were
merely <span class="grk" title="aisthêta aidia">&#945;&#943;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#8048; &#7936;&#7986;&#948;&#953;&#945;</span>, that is, that his idealization of the world was
merely superficial, and left the things idealized very much what they
were before to the sensuous consciousness; and the same may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page425" id="page425"></a>425</span>
said of Spinoza&rsquo;s negation of finite things. It was an external and
imperfect negation, which did not transform the idea of the finite,
but merely substituted the names of attributes and modes for the
names of general and individual substances.</p>

<p>The same defective logic, by which the movement of thought in
determining the substance is regarded as altogether external to the
substance itself, is seen again in Spinoza&rsquo;s conceptions of the relations
of the attributes to each other. Adopting the Cartesian opposition of
mind and matter, he does not see, any more than Descartes, that in
their opposition they are correlative. Or if he did see it (as seems
possible from a passage in his earliest treatise),<a name="fa45d" id="fa45d" href="#ft45d"><span class="sp">45</span></a> he regarded the
correlation as merely subjective, merely belonging to our thought.
They are to him only the two attributes which we happen to know
out of the infinite number belonging to God. There is no necessity
that the substance should manifest itself in just these attributes
and no others, for abstract substance is equally receptive of all
determinations, and equally indifferent to them all. Just because
the unity is merely generic, the differences are accidental, and do
not form by their union any complete whole. If Spinoza had seen
that matter in itself is the correlative opposite of mind in itself, he
need not have sought by abstracting from the difference of these
elements to reach a unity which is manifested in that very difference,
and his absolute would have been not substance but spirit. This
idea he never reached, but we find him approximating to it in two
ways. On the one hand, he condemns the Cartesian conception of
matter as passive and self-external, or infinitely divisible&mdash;as, in
short, the mere opposite of thought.<a name="fa46d" id="fa46d" href="#ft46d"><span class="sp">46</span></a> And sometimes he insists
on the parallelism of extension and thought at the expense of their
opposition in a way that almost anticipates the assertion by Leibnitz
of the essential identity of mind and matter. On the other hand,
he recognizes that this parallelism is not complete. Thought is not
like a picture; it is conscious, and conscious not only of itself,
but of extension. It transcends therefore the absolute distinction
between itself and other attributes. It is only because he cannot rid
himself of the phantom of an extended matter as a thing in itself,
which is entirely different from the idea of it, that Spinoza is prevented
from recognising in mind that unity that transcends all
distinctions, even its own distinction from matter. As it is, his main
reason for saying that intelligence is not an attribute of God, but
merely a mode, seems to be this, that the thought of God must be
conceived as producing its own object, <i>i.e.</i> as transcending the distinction
of subject and object which is necessary to our intelligence.<a name="fa47d" id="fa47d" href="#ft47d"><span class="sp">47</span></a>
But this argument of itself points to a concrete quite as much as to
an abstract unity. It is as consistent with the idea of absolute spirit
as with that of absolute substance. Spinoza&rsquo;s deliberate and formal
doctrine is undoubtedly the latter; but he constantly employs
expressions which imply the former, as when he speaks of God as
<i>causa sui</i>. The higher idea inspires him, though his consciousness
only embraces the lower idea.</p>

<p>The ethical philosophy of Spinoza is determined by the same
principles and embarrassed by the same difficulties as his metaphysics.
In it also we find the same imperfect conception
of the relation of the positive to the negative elements,
<span class="sidenote">Spinoza&rsquo;s ethical system.</span>
and, as a consequence, the same confusion of the highest
unity of thought, the affirmation that subordinates and
transcends all negation with mere abstract affirmation. Or, to put
the same thing in ethical language, Spinoza teaches a morality
which is in every point the opposite of asceticism, a morality of self-assertion
or self-seeking, and not of self-denial. The <i>conatus sese
conservandi</i> is to him the supreme principle of virtue;<a name="fa48d" id="fa48d" href="#ft48d"><span class="sp">48</span></a> yet this self-seeking
is supposed, under the guidance of reason, to identify itself
with the love of man and the love of God, and to find blessedness
not in the reward of virtue, but in virtue itself. It is only confusion
of thought and false mysticism that could object to this result on
the ground of the element of self still preserved in the <i>amor Dei
intellectualis</i>. For it is just the power of identifyihg himself with
that which is wider and higher than his individual being that makes
morality possible to man. But the difficulty lies in this, that
Spinoza will not admit the negative element, the element of mortification
or sacrifice, into morality at all, even as a moment of transition.
For him there is no dead self, by which we may rise to higher things,
no losing of life that we may find it. For the negative is nothing,
it is evil in the only sense in which evil exists, and cannot be the
source of good. The higher affirmation of our own being, the higher
seeking of ourselves which is identical with the love of God, must
therefore be regarded as nothing distinct in kind from that first
seeking of our natural self which in Spinoza&rsquo;s view belongs to us in
common with the animals, and indeed in common with all beings
whatever. It must be regarded merely as a direct development
and extension of the same thing. The main interest of the Spinozistic
ethics therefore lies in observing by what steps he accomplishes this
transition, while excluding altogether the idea of a real division of
the higher and the lower life, the spirit and flesh, and of a conflict
in which the former is developed through the sacrifice of the latter.</p>

<p>Finite creatures exist only as modes of the divine substance, only
so far as they partake in the infinite, or what is the same thing with
Spinoza, in the purely affirmative or self-affirming nature of God.
They therefore must also be self-affirming. They can never limit
themselves; their limit lies in this, that they are not identified with
the infinite substance which expresses itself also in other modes.
In other words, the limit of any finite creature, that which makes it
finite, lies without it, and its own existence, so far as it goes, must
be pure self-assertion and self-seeking. &ldquo;Unaquaeque res quantum
in se est in suo esse perseverare conatur,&rdquo; and this <i>conatus</i> is its very
essence or inmost nature.<a name="fa49d" id="fa49d" href="#ft49d"><span class="sp">49</span></a> In the animals this <i>conatus</i> takes the
form of appetite, in man of desire, which is &ldquo;appetite with the
consciousness of it.&rdquo;<a name="fa50d" id="fa50d" href="#ft50d"><span class="sp">50</span></a> But this constitutes no essential difference
between appetite and desire, for &ldquo;whether a man be conscious of
his appetite or no, the appetite remains one and the same thing.&rdquo;<a name="fa51d" id="fa51d" href="#ft51d"><span class="sp">51</span></a>
Man therefore, like the animals, is purely self-asserting and
self-seeking. He can neither know nor will anything but his own being,
or if he knows or wills anything else, it must be something involved
in his own being. If he knows other beings, or seeks their good,
it must be because their existence and their good are involved in his
own. If he loves and knows God it must be because he cannot know
himself without knowing God, or find his supreme good anywhere
but in God.</p>

<p>What at first makes the language difficult to us is the identification
of will and intelligence. Both are represented as affirming their
objects. Descartes had prepared the way for this when he treated
the will as the faculty of judging or giving assent to certain combinations
of ideas, and distinguished it from the purely intellectual
faculties by which the ideas are apprehended. By this distinction
he had, as he supposed, secured a place for human freedom. <span class="correction" title="amended from Admiting">Admitting</span>
that intelligence is under a law of necessity, he claimed for the
Will a certain latitude or liberty of indifference, a power of giving
or withholding assent in all cases where the relations of ideas were
not absolutely clear and distinct. Spinoza points out that there is
no ground for such a distinction, that the acts of apprehension and
judgment cannot be separated from each other. &ldquo;In the mind
there is no volition, <i>i.e.</i> no affirmation or negation which is not
immediately involved in the idea it apprehends,&rdquo; and therefore
&ldquo;intellect and will are one and the same thing.&rdquo;<a name="fa52d" id="fa52d" href="#ft52d"><span class="sp">52</span></a> If, then, there is
no freedom except the liberty of indifference, freedom is impossible.
Man, like all other beings and things, is under an absolute law of
necessity. All the actions of his will, as well as of his intelligence,
are but different forms of the self-assertive tendency to which he
cannot but yield, because it is one with his very being, or only
ideally distinguishable therefrom. There is, however, another idea
of liberty. Liberty as the opposite of necessity is an absurdity&mdash;it
is impossible for either God or man; but liberty as the opposite of
slavery is possible, and it is actually possessed by God. The divine
liberty consists in this, that God acts from the necessity of his own
nature alone, and is not in any way determined from without.
And the great question of ethics is, How far can man partake in this
liberty? At first it would seem impossible that he should partake
in it. He is a finite being, whose power is infinitely surpassed by
the power of other beings to which he is related. His body acts
only as it is acted on, and his mind cannot therefore apprehend his
body, except as affected by other things. His self-assertion and
self-seeking are therefore confused with the asserting and seeking
of other things, and are never pure. His thought and activity cannot
be understood except through the influence of other things which
lie outside of his consciousness, and upon which his will has no
influence. He cannot know clearly and distinctly either himself or
anything else; how then can he know his own good or determine
himself by the idea of it?</p>

<p>The answer is the answer of Descartes, that the apprehension of
any finite thing involves the adequate idea of the infinite and eternal
nature of God.<a name="fa53d" id="fa53d" href="#ft53d"><span class="sp">53</span></a> This is the primary object of intelligence, in which
alone is grounded the possibility of knowing either ourselves or
anything else. In so far as our knowledge is determined by this
idea, or by the ideas of other things, which are referred to this idea
and seen in its light, in so far its action flows from an internal
and not an external necessity. In so far, on the other hand, as we
are determined by the affections of the body, ideas in which the
nature of our own body and the nature of other things are confused
together, in so far we are determined by an external necessity. Or
to put the same thing in what has been shown to be merely another
way of expression, in so far as we are determined by pure intelligence
we are free, but in so far as we are determined by opinion and
imagination we are slaves.</p>

<p>From these premises it is easy to see what form the opposition
of reason and passion must necessarily take with Spinoza. The
passions belong to our nature as finite; they are grounded on, or
rather are but another form of inadequate ideas; but we are free
only in so far as our ideas either immediately are, or can be made,
adequate. Our idea of God is adequate <i>ex vi termini</i>; our ideas
of the affections of our body are inadequate, but can be made
adequate in so far as they are referred to the idea of God. And as
the idea of God is purely affirmative, this reference to the idea of
God implies the elimination of the negative element from the ideas
of the affections of the body, &ldquo;for nothing that is positive in a false
idea is removed by the presence of truth as such.&rdquo;<a name="fa54d" id="fa54d" href="#ft54d"><span class="sp">54</span></a> Brought into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page426" id="page426"></a>426</span>
contact with the idea of God, all ideas become true and adequate,
by the removal of the negative or false element in them. The idea
of God is, as it were, the touchstone which distinguishes the gold
from the dross. It enables us to detect the higher spiritual element
in the natural passions, and to sever the element belonging to that
pure love of self which is identical with the love of perfection from
the elements belonging to that impure love of our own finite
individuality as such which is identical with the love of evil.</p>

<p>The imperfection in Spinoza&rsquo;s development of this principle has
already been indicated. It is in fact the same imperfection which
runs through his whole system. Just as he supposed that
the ideas of finite things were at once made consistent
<span class="sidenote">Implicit difficulties.</span>
with the idea of the infinite when he had named them
modes, so here his conception of the change through which
selfish natural desire must pass in order to become spiritual is far
too superficial and external. Hence he has no sympathy with
asceticism, but treats it, like Bentham, as a <i>torva el tristis superstitio</i>.
Joy is the &ldquo;transition from less to greater perfection,&rdquo; and cannot
be but good; pain is the &ldquo;transition from greater to less perfection,&rdquo;
and cannot be but evil. The revolt against the medieval opposition
of the nature and spirit is visible in many of his sayings. &ldquo;No
Deity who is not envious can delight in my weakness or hurts, or
can regard as virtues those fears and sighs and tears which are the
signs of the mind&rsquo;s weakness; but contrariwise, the greater is our
joy, the greater is our progress to perfection, and our participation
in the divine nature.&rdquo;<a name="fa55d" id="fa55d" href="#ft55d"><span class="sp">55</span></a> &ldquo;A free man thinks of nothing less than
death, his wisdom is a meditation not of death but of life.&rdquo;<a name="fa56d" id="fa56d" href="#ft56d"><span class="sp">56</span></a> The
same idea, combining with the idea of necessity, leads him to condemn
repentance and pity, as well as pride and humility. Unconsciously,
Spinoza reproduces the principle of asceticism, while
in words he utterly rejects it. For though he tells us that pure
self-complacency is the highest thing we can hope, yet from this
self-complacency all regard to the finite individuality of the subject
is eliminated. &ldquo;Qui Deum amat, conari non potest ut Deus ipsum
contra amet.&rdquo; In like manner, he absolutely condemns all hatred,
envy, rivalry and ambition, as springing out of an over-estimate of
those finite things which one only can possess, while the highest good
is that which is enjoyed the more easily and fully the greater the number
of participants. Yet Spinoza&rsquo;s exaltation of the social life, and
of the love that binds it together, is too like the Buddhist&rsquo;s universal
charity that embraces all creatures, and all creatures equally. Both
are based on an abstraction from all that is individual, only the Buddhist&rsquo;s
abstraction goes a step further, and erases even the distinction
between man and the animals. Spinoza felt the pressure of this all-levelling
logic when he said, &ldquo;I confess I cannot understand how
spirits express God more than the other creatures, for I know that
between the finite and the infinite there is no proportion, and that
the distinction between God and the most excellent of created things
differs not a whit from the distinction between him and the lowest
and meanest of them.&rdquo;<a name="fa57d" id="fa57d" href="#ft57d"><span class="sp">57</span></a> As Pope said, God is &ldquo;as full and perfect
in a hair as a heart&rdquo;; in all finite things there is a ray of divinity,
and in nothing more than a ray. Yet in another epistle Spinoza
contradicts this view, and declares that, while he does not consider
it necessary to &ldquo;know Christ after the flesh, he does think it is
necessary to know the eternal Son of God, <i>i.e.</i> God&rsquo;s eternal wisdom,
which is manifested in all things, but chiefly in the mind of man,
and most of all in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;<a name="fa58d" id="fa58d" href="#ft58d"><span class="sp">58</span></a> In the <i>Ethics</i> the distinction of
man and the animals is treated as an absolute distinction, and it is
asserted with doubtful consistency that the human soul cannot
all be destroyed along with the body, for that there is something
of it which is eternal. Yet from this eternity we must, of course,
eliminate all notion of the consciousness of the finite self as such.
At this point, in short, the two opposite streams of Spinoza&rsquo;s thought,
the positive method he <i>intends</i> to pursue, and the negative or
abstracting method he really <i>does</i> pursue, meet in irreconcilable
contradiction. The finite must be related to the infinite so as to
preserve all that is in it of reality; and therefore its limit or the
negative element in it must be abstracted from. But it turns out
that, with this abstraction from a negative element involved in the
existence of the finite, the positive also disappears, and God is all in
all in a sense that absolutely excludes the existence of the finite.
&ldquo;The mind&rsquo;s intellectual love of God,&rdquo; says Spinoza, &ldquo;is the very
love wherewith God loves himself, not in so far as he is infinite, but
in so far as he can be expressed by the essence of the human mind,
considered under the form of eternity; <i>i.e.</i> the mind&rsquo;s intellectual
love of God is part of the infinite love wherewith God loves himself.&rdquo;<a name="fa59d" id="fa59d" href="#ft59d"><span class="sp">59</span></a>
This double &ldquo;in so far,&rdquo; which returns so frequently in
Spinoza, just conceals for a moment the contradiction of two streams
of thought, one of which must be swallowed up by the other, if they
are once allowed to meet.</p>
</div>

<p>We have now reviewed the main points of the system, which
was the ultimate result of the principles of Descartes. The
importance of this first movement of modern philosophy lies
in its assertion and exhibition of the unity of the intelligible
world with itself and with the mind of man. In this point of
view, it was the philosophical counterpart of Protestantism;
but, like Protestantism in its earliest phase, it passed rapidly
<span class="sidenote">General importance of the Cartesian school.</span>
from the doctrine that God is, without priest or authority,
present to man&rsquo;s spirit, to the doctrine
that man&rsquo;s spirit is as nothing before God. The
object was too powerful for the subject, who effaced
himself before God that he might be strong towards
men. But in this natural movement of feeling and thought it
was forgotten that God who effaced the world and the finite spirit
by his presence could not be a living God. Spinoza gives the
ultimate expression to this tendency, and at the same time
marks its limit, when he says that whatever reality is in the
finite is of the infinite. But he is unsuccessful in showing that,
on the principles on which he starts, there can be any reality in
the finite at all. Yet even if the finite be an illusion, still more
if it be better than an illusion, it requires to be accounted for.
Spinoza accounts for it neither as illusory nor as real. It was
reserved for the following generation of philosophers to assert,
in different ways, the reality of the finite, the value of experience
and the futility of abstractions. Spinoza had declared that true
knowledge consists in seeing things under the form of eternity,
but it is impossible that things can be seen under the form of
eternity unless they have been first seen under the form of
time. The one-sided assertion of individuality and difference in
the schools of Locke and Leibnitz was the natural complement of
the one-sided assertion of universality and unity in the Cartesian
school. But when the individualistic tendency of the 18th
century had exhausted itself, and produced its own refutation
in the works of Kant, it was inevitable that the minds of men
should again turn to the great philosopher, who, with almost
perfect insight working through imperfect logic, first formulated
the idea of a unity presupposed in and transcending the difference
of matter and mind, subject and object.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CARTHAGE<a name="ar81" id="ar81"></a></span> (Phoenician <i>Kart-hadshat</i>, &ldquo;New City&rdquo;; Gr.
<span class="grk" title="Karchêdôn">&#922;&#945;&#961;&#967;&#951;&#948;&#974;&#957;</span>, Lat. <i>Carthago</i> or <i>Carchedon</i>), one of the most
famous cities of antiquity, on the north coast of Africa; it was
founded about 822 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> by the Phoenicians, destroyed for the
first time by the Romans in 146 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, rebuilt by the Romans,
and finally destroyed by the Arabs in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 698. It was situated
in the heart of the Sinus Uticensis (mod. Gulf of Tunis), which
is protected on the west by the promontory of Apollo (mod.
Ras Ali el Mekki), and on the east by the promontory of Mercury
or Cape Bon (mod. Ras Addar). Its position naturally formed
a sort of bastion on the inner curve of the bay between the
Lake of Tunis on the south and the marshy plain of Utica (Sukhara)
on the north. Cape Gamart, the Arab village of Sidi-bu-Saïd
and the small harbour of Goletta (La Goulette, Halk el Wad)
form a triangle which represents the area of Carthage at its
greatest, including its extramural suburbs. Of this area the
highest point is Sidi-bu-Saïd, which stands on a lofty cliff about
490 ft. high. On Cape Gamart (Kamart) was the chief cemetery;
the citadel, Byrsa, was on the hill on which to-day stand the
convent of Les Pères Blancs (White Fathers) and the cathedral
of St Louis. The harbours lay about three-fifths of a mile
south of Byrsa, near the modern hospital of the Khram, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page427" id="page427"></a>427</span>
Cartagenna. The tongue of land, which runs from the harbours
as far as Goletta, to the mouth of the Catadas which connects
the Lake of Tunis with the sea, was known as <i>taenia</i> (ribbon,
band) or <i>ligula</i> (diminutive of <i>lingua</i>, tongue). The isthmus
connecting the peninsula of Carthage with the mainland was
roughly estimated by Polybius as 25 stades (about 15,000 ft.);
the peninsula itself, according to Strabo, had a circumference
of 360 stades (41 m.). The distance between Gamart and
Goletta is about 6 m.</p>

<p>From Byrsa, which is only 195 ft. above the sea, there is a fine
view; thence it is possible to see how Carthage was able at once
to dominate the sea and the gently undulating plains which
stretch westward as far as Tunis and the line of the river Bagradas
(mod. Mejerda). On the horizon, on the other side of the Gulf
of Tunis, rise the chief heights of the mountain-chain which was
the scene of so many fierce struggles between Carthage and Rome,
between Rome and the Vandals:&mdash;the Bu-Kornaïn (&ldquo;Two-Horned
Mountain&rdquo;), crowned by the ruins of the temple of
Saturn Balcaranensis; Jebel Ressas, behind which lie the ruins of
Neferis; Zaghwan, the highest point in Zeugitana; Hammam-Lif,
Rades (Ghades, Gades, the ancient Maxula) on the coast, and
10 m. to the south-west the &ldquo;white&rdquo; Tunis (<span class="grk" title="Leukos Tunês">&#955;&#949;&#965;&#954;&#8056;&#962; &#932;&#973;&#957;&#951;&#962;</span>
of Diodorus) and the fertile hills of Ariana. All round Byrsa,
alike on the plain and on the slopes, are fields of barley, vineyards
and patches of cactus, interrupted only by huge heaps of rubbish
and excavation-mounds, the haunts of green lizards, and by
houses and villages built of materials drawn for many a century
from the ancient ruins.</p>

<p>The ancient harbours were distinguished as the military and the
commercial. The remains of the latter are to be seen in a partially
ruined artificial lagoon which originally, according to
Beulé, had an area of nearly 60 acres; there were, however,
in addition a large quay for unloading freight along the shore,
and huge basins or outer harbours protected by jetties, the remains
of which are still visible at the water-level. The military
harbour, known as Cothon, communicated with the commercial
by means of a canal now partially ruined; it was circular in
shape, surrounded by large docks 16¼ ft. wide, and capable of
holding 220 vessels, though its area was only some 22 acres.
In the centre was an islet from which the admiral could inspect
the whole fleet.<a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>Among the other ruins which have been identified are the circus
or hippodrome, traversed by the railway at the north of the
village of Duar-es-Shat; the forum, between Cothon and Byrsa,
where stood the Curia, the regular place of assembly of the senate,
and near which were the moneychangers&rsquo; shops, the tribunal,
the temple of Apollo, and in the Byzantine period the baths of
Theodora. Three main streets led from the forum to Byrsa.</p>

<p>The hill of St Louis, the ancient citadel of Byrsa, has a circuit
of 4525 ft. It appears to have been surrounded at least at
certain points by several lines of fortifications. It was, however,
dismantled by P. Scipio Africanus the younger, in 146 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, and
was only refortified by Theodosius II. in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 424; subsequently its
walls were again renewed by Belisarius in 553. On the plateau
of Byrsa have been found the most ancient of the Punic tombs,
huge cisterns in the eastern part, and near the chapel of St Louis
the foundations of the famous temple of Eshmun (see below),
and the palace of the Roman proconsul.</p>

<p>About 325 ft. from the railway station of La Malga are the still
imposing ruins of the amphitheatre. Near by, at the spot
called Bir el Jebana, Père Delattre has discovered four cemeteries,
one of which contains the tombs of state officials or servants of
the imperial government. Rather more than half a mile north-west
of Byrsa are the huge cisterns of La Malga, which, at the
time of the Arab geographer, Idr&#299;s&#299;, still comprised twenty-four
parallel covered reservoirs, 325 ft. by 71½ ft.; of these fourteen
only remain.</p>

<p>On the hill of the Petit Séminaire, which is separated from
Byrsa by a valley, Père Delattre has discovered a Christian
basilica, the baths of Gargilius, large graves with several levels
of tombs, and much débris of sculpture, which, however, is
insufficient to enable us to say that this is the site of the temple
of Tanit or Juno Caelestis. The quarter of Dermèche, near the
sea, whose name recalls the Latin <i>Thermis</i> or <i>Thermas</i>, is
remarkable for the imposing remains of the baths (<i>thermae</i>) of
Antoninus. In one place called Douimés was the Ceramicus
where excavation has discovered a graceful basilica, proto-Punic
tombs, potters&rsquo; ovens with numerous terra-cotta moulds which
were abandoned after the siege in 146 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, and finally a Roman
palace with superb marble statues. Farther on are huge reservoirs
of Borj-Jedid which are sufficiently well-preserved to be
used again.</p>

<p>Behind the small fort of Borj-Jedid is the plateau of the Odeum
where the theatre and fine marble statues of the Roman period
have been laid bare; beyond is the great Christian basilica of
Damus-el-Karita (perhaps a corruption of <i>Domus Caritatis</i>);
in the direction of Sidi-bu-Saïd is the <i>platea nova</i>, the huge stairway
of which, like so many other Carthaginian buildings, has of late
years been destroyed by the Arabs for use as building material;
on the coast near St Monica is the necropolis of Rabs where
Delattre dug up fine anthropoid sarcophagi of the Punic period.</p>

<p>In the quarter of Megara (Magaria, mod. La Marsa) it would
seem that there never were more than isolated buildings, villas
in the midst of gardens. At Jebel Khaui (Cape Kamart) there
is a great necropolis, the sepulchral chambers of which were
long ago rifled by Arabs and Vandals. This cemetery had a
Jewish quarter.</p>

<p>We must mention finally the gigantic remains in the western
plain of the Roman aqueduct which carried water from Jebel
Zaghwan (<i>Mons Zeugitanus</i>) and Juggar (Zucchara) to the
cisterns of La Malga. From the <i>nymphaeum</i> of Zaghwan to
Carthage this aqueduct is 61 Roman miles (about 56 English
miles) long; in the plain of Manuba its arches are nearly 49 ft.
high.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Though several famous travellers visited and described the ruins
of Carthage during the first thirty years of the 19th century, such as
Major Humbert, Chateaubriand, Estrup, no scientific investigations
took place till 1833. In that year Captain Falbe, Danish consul at
Tunis, made a plan of the ruins so far as they were visible. In 1837
there was formed in Paris, on the initiative of Dureau de la Malle, a
<i>Société pour les fouilles de Carthage</i>; under the auspices of this body
Falbe and Sir Grenville Temple undertook researches, and a little
later Sir Thomas Read, English consul, following the example of the
Genoese and the Pisans, carried away to England the mosaics,
columns and statues of the baths of Antoninus. The Abbé Bourgade,
chaplain of the church of St Louis erected in 1841, collected
together Punic stelae and other antiquities from the surrounding
plain; these formed the nucleus of the magnificent museum subsequently
formed by Père Delattre at the instigation of Cardinal
Lavigerie. Between 1856 and 1858 Nathan Davis made excavations
on the supposed site of the Odeum, and in 1859 Beulé undertook
his celebrated investigations on Byrsa. Among other explorers
were A. Daux in 1866; von Maltzan in 1870; E. de Sainte-Marie in
1874; Ch. d&rsquo;Hérisson in 1883; E. Babelon and S. Reinach in 1884;
Vernaz in 1885; Gauckler in 1903. Of these the majority were sent
officially by the French government. But their attempts were
partial, disjointed and without any systematic plan; they were
entirely superseded by the brilliant and persevering work of R.P.
Delattre. The Musée Lavigerie, the result of his labours, contains
a vast archaeological treasure, the interest of which is doubled by
the fact that it stands in the very midst of the ancient site.
Unfortunately Delattre&rsquo;s work suffered too often from the absence of
a cordial understanding with the directors of the antiquities
department, La Blanchère and P. Gauckler, who, having themselves
undertaken excavations, transported their finds to the Bardo
museum, by the help of the public funds at their disposal.</p>

<p>The main authority for the topography and the history of the
excavations is Aug. Audollent&rsquo;s <i>Carthage romaine</i> (Paris, 1901). A
topographical and archaeological map of the site was published
under the direction of Colonel Dolot and with the assistance of
Delattre and Gauckler by the Ministère de l&rsquo;Instruction Publique in
1907.</p>
</div>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The history of Carthage falls into four periods:
(1) from the foundation to the beginning of the wars with the
Sicilian Greeks in 550 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>; (2) from 550 to 265, the first year of
the Punic Wars; (3) the Punic Wars to the fall of Carthage in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page428" id="page428"></a>428</span>
146 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>; (4) the periods of Roman and Byzantine rule down to
the destruction of the city by the Arabs in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 698.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Foundation to 550 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></i>&mdash;From an extremely remote period
Phoenician sailors had visited the African coast and had had
commercial relations with the Libyan tribes who inhabited the
district which forms the modern Tunis. In the 16th century <span class="sc">b.c.</span>
the Sidonians already had trading stations on the coast; with
the object of competing with the Tyrian colony at Utica they
established a trading station called Camb&#275; or Caccab&#275; on the very
site afterwards occupied by Carthage. Near Borj-Jedid unmistakable
traces of this early settlement have been found, though
nothing is known of its history. According to the classical
tradition Carthage was founded about 850 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> by Tyrian emigrants
led by Elissa or Elissar, the daughter of the Tyrian king Mutton I.,
fleeing from the tyranny of her brother Pygmalion. According to
the story, Elissa subsequently received the name of Dido, <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;the
fugitive.&rdquo; Camb&#275; welcomed the new arrivals, who bought from
the mixed Libyo-Phoenician peoples of the neighbourhood,
tributaries of the Libyan king Japon, a piece of land on which
to build a &ldquo;new city,&rdquo; <i>Kart-hadshat</i>, the Greek and Roman
forms of the name. The story goes that Dido, having obtained
&ldquo;as much land as could be contained by the skin of an ox,&rdquo;
proceeded to cut the skin of a slain ox into strips narrow enough
to extend round the whole of the hill, which afterwards from
this episode gained the name of <i>Byrsa</i>. This last detail obviously
arose from a mere play on words by which <span class="grk" title="Bursa">&#914;&#973;&#961;&#963;&#945;</span> &ldquo;hide,&rdquo;
&ldquo;skin,&rdquo; is confused with the Phoenician <i>bosra, borsa</i>, &ldquo;citadel,&rdquo;
&ldquo;fortress.&rdquo; In memory of its Tyrian origin, Carthage paid an
annual tribute to the temple of Melkarth at Tyr, and under the
Roman empire coins were struck showing Dido fleeing in a galley,
or presiding over the building of Byrsa. On the Vatican <i>Virgil</i>
there is a representation in miniature of workmen shaping
marble blocks and columns for Dido&rsquo;s palace.</p>

<p>The early history of Carthage is very obscure. It is only in
the 6th century that real history begins. By this time the city
is unquestionably a considerable capital with a domain divided
into the three districts of Zeugitana (the environs of Carthage
and the peninsula of C. Bon), Byzacium (the shore of the Syrtes),
and the third comprising the emporia which stretch in the form
of a crescent to the centre of the Great Syrtis as far as Cyrenaica.
The first contest against the Greeks arose from a boundary
question between the settlements of Carthage and those of the
Greeks of Cyrene. The limits were eventually fixed and marked
by a monument known as the &ldquo;Altar of Philenae.&rdquo; The destruction
of Tyre by Nebuchadrezzar (<i>q.v.</i>), in the first half of
the 6th century, enabled Carthage to take its place as mistress
of the Mediterranean. The Phoenician colonies founded by
Tyre and Sidon in Sicily and Spain, threatened by the Greeks,
sought help from Carthage, and from this period dates the
Punic<a name="fa2e" id="fa2e" href="#ft2e"><span class="sp">2</span></a> supremacy in the western Mediterranean. The Greek
colonization of Sicily was checked, while Carthage established
herself on all the Sicilian coast and the neighbouring islands as
far as the Balearic Islands and the coast of Spain. The inevitable
conflict between Greece and Carthage broke out about 550.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Wars with the Greeks.</i>&mdash;In 550, the Carthaginians, led by the
suffetes Malchus, conquered almost all Sicily and expelled the
Greeks. In 536 they defeated the Phocaeans and the Massaliotes
before Alalia on the Corsican coast. But Malchus, having failed
in Sardinia, was banished by the stern Carthaginian senate
and swore to avenge himself. He laid siege to Carthage itself,
and, after having sacrificed his son Carthalo to his lust for
vengeance, entered the city as a victor. He ruled until he was
put to death by the party which had supported him. Mago,
son of Hanno, succeeded Malchus, as suffetes and general-in-chief.
He was the true founder of the Carthaginian military power.
He conquered Sardinia and the Balearic Islands, where he founded
Port Mahon (Portus Magonis), and so increased the power of
Carthage that he was able to force commercial treaties upon
the Etruscans, and the Greeks of both Sicily and Italy. The
first agreement between Carthage and Rome was made in 509,
one year after the expulsion of the Tarquins, in the consulship of
Junius Brutus and Marcus Horatius. The text is preserved by
Polybius (<i>Hist.</i> iii. 22-23). It assigned Italy to the Romans and
the African waters to Carthage, but left Sicily as a dangerous
neutral zone.</p>

<p>Mago was succeeded as commander-in-chief by his elder
son Hasdrubal (c. 500), who was thrice chosen suffetes; he
died in Sardinia about 485. His brother Hamilcar, having
collected a fleet of 200 galleys for the conquest of Sicily, was
defeated by the combined forces of Gelo of Syracuse and Theron
of Agrigentum under the walls of Himera in 480, the year in
which the Persian fleet was defeated at Salamis (some say
the two battles were simultaneous); it is said that 150,000
Carthaginians were taken prisoners. The victory is celebrated
by Pindar (<i>Pyth.</i> i.).</p>

<p>These two leaders of the powerful house of the Barcidae each left
three sons. Those of Hasdrubal were Hannibal, Hasdrubal and
Sapho; those of Hamilcar, Himilco, Hanno and Gisco. All,
under various titles, succeeded to the authority which it had
already enjoyed. About 460 Hanno,<a name="fa3e" id="fa3e" href="#ft3e"><span class="sp">3</span></a> passing beyond the
Pillars of Hercules (Straits of Gibraltar), founded settlements
along the West African coast in the modern Senegal and Guinea,
and even in Madeira and the Canary Islands.</p>

<p>In Sicily the war lasted for a century with varying success.
In 406 Hannibal and Himilco destroyed Agrigentum and
threatened Gela, but the Carthaginians were forced back on
their strongholds in the south-west by Dionysius the Elder,
Dionysius the Younger, Timoleon and Agathocles successively,
whose cause was aided by a terrible plague and civil troubles
in Carthage itself, A certain Hanno, unquestionably of the
Barcide house, attempted to seize the supreme power, but
his partisans were overwhelmed and he himself suffered the
most cruel punishment. Profiting by these troubles, Timoleon
defeated the Carthaginians at Crimissus in 340, and compelled
them to sue for peace. This peace was not of long duration;
Agathocles crossed to Africa and besieged Carthage, which was
then handicapped by the conspiracy of Bomilcar. Bomilcar
was crucified, and Agathocles having been obliged to return to
Sicily, his general Eumarcus was compelled to carry his army out
of Africa, where it had maintained itself for three years (August
310 to October 307). After the death of Agathocles, the Carthaginians
re-established their supremacy in Sicily, and Mago
even offered assistance to Rome against the invasion of Pyrrhus
(480). Pyrrhus crossed to Sicily in 277, and was preparing to
emulate Agathocles by sailing to Africa when he was compelled
to return to Italy (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sicily</a></span>: <i>History</i>).</p>

<p>Delivered from these dangers and more arrogant than before,
Carthage claimed the monopoly of Mediterranean waters, and
seized every foreign ship found between Sardinia and the Pillars
of Hercules. &ldquo;At Carthage,&rdquo; said Polybius, &ldquo;no one is blamed,
however he may have acquired his wealth.&rdquo; The sailors took
the utmost care to conceal the routes which they followed; there
is a story that a Carthaginian ship, pursued by a Roman galley
as far as the Atlantic, preferred to be driven out of her course
and sunk rather than reveal the course to the Cassiterides,
whither she was bound in quest of tin. The owner being saved,
the senate made good his losses from the public treasury (Strabo,
iii. 5. 11).</p>

<p>(3) <i>Wars with Rome.</i><a name="fa4e" id="fa4e" href="#ft4e"><span class="sp">4</span></a>&mdash;The first Punic War lasted twenty-seven
years (268-241); it was fought by Carthage for the defence
of her Sicilian possessions and her supremacy in the Tyrrhenian
Sea. The Romans, victorious at the naval battles of Mylae
(Melazzo) and Ecnomus (260 and 256), sent M. Atilius Regulus
with an army to Africa. But the Carthaginians, by the help of
the Spartan Xanthippus, were successful, and Regulus was
captured. The fighting was then transferred to Sicily, where
Hasdrubal was defeated at Panormus (250); subsequently the
Romans failed before Lilybaeum and were defeated at Drepanum,
but their victory at the Aegates Islands ended the war (241).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page429" id="page429"></a>429</span>
Carthage now desired to disband her forces, but the mercenaries
claimed their arrears of pay, and on being refused revolted under
Spendius and Matho, pillaged the suburbs of Carthage and laid
siege to the city itself. Only the genius of Hamilcar Barca raised
the siege; the mercenaries were caught in the defile of the Axe,
where they were cut down without mercy. This war, which all
but ruined Carthage, is known to the Roman historians as the
<i>bellum inexpiabile.</i></p>

<p>This peril averted, Carthage undertook the conquest of Spain.
It was the work of Hamilcar, and lasted nine years up to the day
of Hamilcar&rsquo;s death, sword in hand, in 228. His son-in-law,
Hasdrubal Pulcher, built Carthagena in 227 and concluded with
Rome a treaty by which the Ebro was adopted as the boundary
of the Carthaginian sphere. On his death the soldiers chose for
themselves as leader Hannibal, son of Hamilcar. At this period
Carthage, with a population of perhaps 1,000,000, was in the
enjoyment of extraordinary prosperity alike in its internal
industries and in its foreign trade. The manufacture of woven
goods, especially, was a flourishing industry; the Greek writer
Polemo records a special treaty dealing with Carthaginian
fabrics which were a recognized luxury throughout the ancient
world. In Sicily, Italy and Greece the Carthaginians sold
especially black slaves, ivory, metals, precious stones and all
the products of Central Africa, which came thence by caravan.
In Spain they sought copper and silver, and it was by them that
the modern mines of Huelva, as also those of Osca and Carthagena,
were first exploited. The district round Carthage, with
its amazing fertility, was the granary of the city, as it was later
that of Rome. Mago had drawn up a treaty dealing with agriculture
and&rsquo; rural economy generally, which was subsequently
brought to Rome and translated into Latin by Decimus Silanus
by order of the senate (J.P. Mahaffy, &ldquo;The Work of Mago,&rdquo; in
<i>Hermathena</i>, xv. pp. 29-35).</p>

<p>In the midst of this prosperity the Second War with Rome
broke out. At this time the genius of Carthage is incarnate in
Hannibal; his campaigns in Spain, Italy and Africa have won
the admiration of military experts of all periods. The war
became inevitable in 210 when Hannibal captured Saguntum,
which was in alliance with Rome. Passing through Spain and
Gaul, Hannibal resolved to carry the war into the heart of Italy
(218-217). The battles of the Ticinus, Trebia and Trasimene
Lake are but stages in the wonderful progress which culminated
in the battle of Cannae (August 2, 216). The road to Rome was
now open to him, but he did not profit by his advantage, while
the Carthaginian senate, to its shame, withheld all further
support. His brother Hasdrubal with his relieving army was
defeated at the Metaurus in 207; the Romans recovered their
hold in Spain, and, seeing that Hannibal was unable to move in
Italy, carried the war back to Africa. Hearing that Scipio had
taken Utica (203) and defeated Hasdrubal and Syphax, king of
Numidia, Hannibal returned from Italy, but with a hastily
levied army was defeated at Zama (October 19, 202). The subsequent
peace was disastrous to Carthage, which lost its fleet
and all save its African possessions.</p>

<p>After the Second War Carthage soon revived. The population
is said still to have numbered 700,000, and despite its humiliation,
the city never ceased to inspire alarm at Rome. The Numidian
prince Massinissa, rival of Syphax and a Roman protégé, took
advantage of a clause in the treaty of 202, which forbade Carthage
to make war without the consent of the Roman senate, to extend
his possessions at the expense of Carthage. In response to a
protest from Carthage an embassy including M. Porcius Cato the
Elder was sent to inquire into the matter, and Cato was so
impressed with the city as a whole that on returning to Rome
he never made a speech without concluding with the warning
&ldquo;Delenda est Carthago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this time there were three political parties in Carthage:
(1) that which upheld the Roman alliance, (2) hat which advocated
the Numidian alliance, and (3) the popular party. These
three were led respectively by Hanno, Hannibal Passer, Hasdrubal
and Carthalo. The popular faction, which was turbulent
and exasperated by the bad faith of the Romans, expelled the
Numidian party and declared war in 149 on Massinissa, who was
victorious at Oroscope. Rome then intervened, determined
finally to destroy her now enfeebled rival. War was declared on
the pretext that Carthage had engaged in war with Massinissa
without the sanction of Rome. The third Punic War lasted three
years, and after a heroic resistance the City fell in 146. The last
champions of liberty entrenched themselves under Hasdrubal
in the temple of Eshmun, the site of which is now occupied by
the chapel of St Louis. The Roman troops were let loose to
plunder and burn. The thick bed of cinders, blackened stones,
broken glass, fragments of metal twisted by fire, half-calcined
bones, which is found to-day at a depth of 13 to 16 ft. under the
remains of Roman Carthage between Byrsa and the harbours,
bears grim witness, in accord with the accounts of Polybius and
Appian, to the terrible fate which overtook this part of the city.
Before long a commission arrived from Rome to decide the fate
of the province of Carthage. In the city itself, temples, houses
and fortifications were levelled to the ground, the site was
dedicated with solemn imprecations to the infernal gods, and all
human habitation throughout the vast ruined area was expressly
forbidden.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Constitutional History.</i>&mdash;The narrative must here be interrupted
by an account of the political and religious development of Phoenician
Carthage. Carthage was an aristocratic republic based on wealth
rather than on birth. Indeed, the popular party, which included
certain noble families such as the Barcidae, was always powerful,
and thus government by demagogues was not infrequent. So
Aristotle, writing about 330, emphasizes the importance of great
wealth in Carthaginian politics. The government was in fact a
plutocracy. The aristocratic party was represented by the two
suffetes and the senate; the democratic by the popular assembly.
The suffetes (<i>Sofetim</i>) presided in the senate and controlled the civil
administration; the office was annual, but there was no limit to
re-election. Hannibal was elected for twenty-two years. The
senate, which, like that of Tyre, was composed of 300 members,
exercised ultimate control over all public affairs, decided on peace
and war, nominated the Commission of Ten, which was charged
with aiding and controlling the suffetes. This commission was
subsequently replaced, by a council of one hundred, called by the
Greeks <i>gerousia</i>. This tribunal, which maintained law and order
and called the generals to account, gradually became a tyrannical
inquisition. Frequently it met at night in the Temple of Eshmun
On Byrsa, in secret sessions described by Aristotle as <span class="grk" title="sussitia tôn
hetairiôn">&#963;&#965;&#963;&#963;&#943;&#964;&#953;&#945; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7953;&#964;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#953;&#8182;&#957;</span>.</p>

<p>The popular assembly was composed, not of all the citizens, but
of the <i>timuchi</i> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="timê, echein">&#964;&#953;&#956;&#7968;, &#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>), <i>i.e.</i> those who possessed a certain
property-qualification. The election of the suffetes had to be ratified
by this assembly. The two bodies were almost always in opposition,
and this was one of the chief causes of the ruin of Carthage.</p>

<p>The army was recruited externally by senators who were sent to
the great <i>emporia</i> or trade-centres, even to the most remote, to
contract with local princes for men and officers. The payments,
agreed upon in this way, were frequently in arrears; hence the
terrible revolts such as that of the &ldquo;bellum inexpiabile.&rdquo; It was
not till the 3rd century that Carthage, in imitation of the kings of
Syria and Egypt, began to make use of elephants in war. The
elephant used was the African type (<i>elephas capensis</i>), which was
smaller than the Asiatic (<i>elephas indicus</i>), though with longer ears.
In addition to the mercenaries, the army contained a legion composed
of young men belonging to the best families in the state;
this force was important as a nursery of officers.</p>

<p><i>Religion</i>.&mdash;The religion of Carthage was that of the Phoenicians.
Over an army of minor deities (<i>alonim</i> and <i>baalim</i>) towered the
trinity of great gods composed of Baal-Ammon or Moloch (identified
by the Romans with Cronus or Saturn); Tanit, the virgin
goddess of the heavens and the moon, the Phoenician Astarte, and
known as Juno Caelestis in the Roman period; Eshmun, the protecting
deity and protector of the acropolis, generally identified
with Aesculapius. There were also special cults: of Iolaus or
Tammuz-Adonis, whom the Romans identified to some extent with
Mercury; of the god Patechus or Pygmaeus, a deformed and
repulsive monster like the Egyptian Ptah, whose images were placed
on the prows of ships to frighten the enemy; and lastly of the Tyrian
Melkarth, whose functions were analogous to those of Hercules.
The statue of this god was carried to Rome after the siege of 146
(Pliny, <i>Nat. Hist.</i> xxxvi. 12. 39). From inscriptions we know the
names of other minor deities, which are perhaps only other names
of the same gods, <i>e.g.</i> Rabbat Umma, &ldquo;the great mother&rdquo;; Baalat
haedrat, &ldquo;mistress of the sanctuary&rdquo;; Ashtoreth (Astarte), Illat,
Sakon, Tsaphon, Sid, Aris (? Ares).</p>

<p>From the close of the 4th century <span class="sc">b.c.</span> the intimate relations
between the Carthaginians and the Sicilian Greeks began to introduce
Hellenic elements into this religion. In the forum of Carthage was a
temple to Apollo containing a colossal statue, which was transported
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page430" id="page430"></a>430</span>
to Rome. The Carthaginians once at least sent offerings to Delphi,
and Tanit approximated to some extent to Demeter; hence on the
coins we find the head of Tanit or the Punic Astarte crowned with
ears of corn, in imitation of the coins of the Greek Sicilian colonies.
The symbol of Tanit is the crescent moon; in her temple at Carthage
was preserved a famous veil or <i>peplus</i> which was venerated as the
city&rsquo;s palladium. On the innumerable votive stelae which have
been unearthed, we find invocations to Tanit and Baal-Ammon,
as two associate deities (<span class="grk" title="theoi paredroi">&#952;&#949;&#959;&#8054; &#960;&#940;&#961;&#949;&#948;&#961;&#959;&#953;</span>). The usual formula in these
inscriptions is, &ldquo;To the great lady Tanit, the manifestation [reflex,
face] of Baal (<i>Tanti-Pen&#275;-Baal</i>) and to our lord Baal-Ammon,
the vow of Bomilcar, son of Mago, son of Bomilcar, because they
have heard his prayer&rdquo; (<i>Corp. inscr. semit.</i> vol. i. pp. 276 f.;
Audollent, <i>Carth. Rom.</i> p. 369).</p>

<p>Baal-Ammon or Moloch, the great god of all Libya, is represented
as an old man with ram&rsquo;s horns on his forehead; the ram is frequently
found with his statues. He appears also with a scythe in his hand
(&ldquo;<i>falcem ferens senex pingitur</i>.&rdquo; St Cyprian, <i>De idol. vanit.</i> 11).
At Carthage children were sacrificed to him, and in his temple there
was a colossal bronze statue in the arms of which were placed the
children who were to be sacrificed (Diod. Sic. xx. 14; Justin xviii.
6, xix. 1; Plut. <i>De superstit.</i> 13, <i>De sera num. vindic.</i> 6.). The
children slipped one by one from the arms into a furnace amid the
plaudits of fanatical worshippers. These sacrifices persisted even
under Roman rule; Tertullian states that even in his time they
took place in secret (<i>Apolog.</i> cix.; cf. Delattre, &ldquo;Inscript. de Carth.,&rdquo;
in <i>Bulletin épigraphique</i>, iv. p. 317; Audollent, op. cit. p. 398).</p>
</div>

<p>(4) <i>Roman Period.</i>&mdash;In 122 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, twenty-four years after the
destruction of the city by Scipio Aemilianus, the Roman senate,
on the proposal of Rubrius, decided to plant a Latin colony on
the site. C. Gracchus and Fulvius Flaccus were entrusted
with the foundation of the new city, which was christened
<i>Colonia Junonia</i>, and placed under the protection of Juno
Caelestis, the new name for the Punic Tanit. But its prosperity
was obstructed both by unpropitious omens and by the very
recollection of the ancient feud, and fifty years later Marius,
proscribed by Sulla, found the ruins practically deserted. In
the neighbourhood were the scattered remnants of the old Punic
population, who, according to Athenaeus (<i>Deipnosoph.</i> v. 50),
had actually had the assurance to send ambassadors to Mithradates
the Great assuring him of their support against Rome.
Ultimately M. Minucius Rufus passed a law abrogating that of
122 and suppressing the <i>Colonia Junonia</i>.</p>

<p>Julius Caesar, pursuing the lost supporters of Pompey,
encamped on the ruins of the city, and there, according to
tradition, had a dream which induced him to re-establish the
abandoned colony. Returning to Rome, he despatched thither
the poor citizens who were demanding land from him. Later on
Augustus sent new colonists, and, henceforward, the machinery
of administration was regularly centred there (Appian viii. 136;
Dio Cass. lxxx. 1; Audollent, op. cit. p. 46). The proconsuls of
the African province had hitherto lived at Utica; in 14-13 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>
C. Sentius Saturninus transferred his headquarters to Carthage,
which was henceforth known as <i>Colonia Julia Carthago</i>. Several
inscriptions use this name, as also the bronze coins which bear
the heads of Augustus and Tiberius, and were struck at first in
the name of the <i>suffetes</i>, afterwards in that of <i>duumviri</i>.</p>

<p>Pomponius Mela and Strabo already describe Carthage as
among the greatest and most wealthy cities of the empire.
Herodian puts it second to Rome, and such is the force of tradition
that the Roman citizens resident in Carthage boasted of its
Punic past, and loved to recall its glory. Virgil in the <i>Aeneid</i>
celebrated the misfortunes of Dido, whom the colonists ultimately
identified with Tanit-Astarte; a public Dido-cult grew up, and
the citizens even pretended to have discovered the very house
from which she had watched the departure of Aeneas. The
religious character of these legends, coupled with the city&rsquo;s
resumption of its old role as mistress of Africa, and its independent
spirit, reawakened the old distrust, and even up to the
invasions of the Vandals the jealous rivalry of Rome forbade
the reconstruction of the city walls.</p>

<p>The revolt of L. Clodius Macer, legate of Numidia, in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 68
was warmly supported by Carthage, and one of the coins of this
short-lived power bears the symbol of Carthage personified.
At the moment of the accession of Vitellius, Piso, governor of
the province of Africa, was in his turn proclaimed emperor at
Carthage. A little later, under Antoninus Pius, we read of a fire
which devastated the quarter of the forum; about the same
time, <i>i.e.</i> under Hadrian and Antoninus, there was built the
famous Zaghwan aqueduct, which poured more than seven
million gallons of water a day into the reservoirs of the Mapalia
(La Malga); the cost of this gigantic work was defrayed by a
special tax which pressed heavily on the inhabitants as late as
the reign of Septimius Severus; allusions to it are made on the
coin-types of this emperor (E. Babelon, <i>Revista italiana di
numismatica</i>, 1903, p. 157).</p>

<p>In the early history of Christianity Carthage played an
auspicious part, in virtue of the number of its disciples, the
energy and learning of their leaders, the courage and eloquence
of its teachers, the persecutions of which it was the scene, the
number of its councils and the heresies of which it witnessed
the birth, propagation or extinction (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Carthage, Synods of</a></span>).
The labours of Delattre have filled the St Louis museum at
Carthage with memorials of the early Church. From the end
of the 2nd century there was a bishop of Carthage; the first was
Agrippinus, the second Optatus. At the head of the apologists,
whom the persecutions inspired, stands Tertullian. In 202 or
203, in the amphitheatre, where Cardinal Lavigerie erected a
cross in commemoration, occurred the martyrdom of Perpetua
and Felicitas. Tertullian was succeeded (248) by a no less
famous bishop Cyprian. About this time the proconsul Gordian
had himself proclaimed (239) emperor at Thysdrus (El Jem).
Shortly afterwards Sabinianus, aspiring to the same dignity,
was besieged by the procurator of Mauretania; the inhabitants
gave him up and thus obtained a disgraceful pardon (R. Cagnat,
<i>L&rsquo;armée romaine d&rsquo;Afrique</i> p. 52; Audollent, op. cit. p. 73).
Peace being restored, the persecution of the Christians was
renewed by an edict of the emperor Decius (250). Cyprian
escaped by hiding, and subsequently caused the heresy of
Novatian to be condemned in the council of 251. In 257, in a
new persecution under Valerian, Cyprian was beheaded by the
proconsul Galerius Maximus.</p>

<p>About 264 or 265 a certain Celsus proclaimed himself emperor
at Carthage, but was quickly slain. Probus, like Hadrian and
Severus, visited the city, and Maximian had new baths constructed.
Under Constantius Chlorus, Maxentius proclaimed
himself emperor in Africa; this caused great excitement in
Carthage, and the garrison, which was hostile to the pretender,
compelled L. Domitius Alexander to assume the purple.
Domitius was, however, captured by Maxentius and strangled
at Carthage. About 311 there arose the famous Donatist
heresy, supported by 270 African bishops (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Donatists</a></span> and
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Constantine I</a></span>.). At the synod of Carthage in 411 this heresy
was condemned owing to the eloquence of Augustine. Two
years later the Carthaginian sectaries even ventured upon a
political rebellion under the leadership of Heraclianus, who
proclaimed himself emperor and actually dared to make a descent
on Italy itself, leaving his son-in-law Sabinus in command at
Carthage. Being defeated he fled precipitately to Carthage,
where he was put to death (413). Donatism was followed by
Pelagianism (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Pelagius</a></span>), also of Carthaginian origin, and
these religious troubles were not settled when in May 429 the
Vandals, on the appeal of Count Boniface, governor of Africa,
crossed the Straits of Gibraltar and invaded Mauretania. Genseric,
who was hailed with one accord by all the different sectaries
as the champion of their several views, appeared in 439 before
the walls of Carthage, which had been hastily rebuilt after five
hundred years by the order of Theodosius II. The priest
Salvianus has left a splendid picture of Carthage at this moment
(<i>de Gubern.</i> vii. 16). It had 500,000 inhabitants, and 22 basilicas
(several of which have been discovered by Delattre). Genseric
entered almost without a blow (October 19, 439), and gave
over the city to plunder before departing for his attack on Italy.
From this time Carthage became, in the hands of the Vandals,
a mere pirate stronghold, such as Tunis and Algiers were subsequently
to become. Once, in 470, the fleet of the Eastern
empire under the orders of Basiliscus appeared in the Bay of
Carthage, but Genseric succeeded in setting fire to the attacking
ships and from Byrsa watched their entire annihilation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page431" id="page431"></a>431</span></p>

<p><i>Byzantine Rule</i>.&mdash;Under Genseric&rsquo;s successors (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Vandals</a></span>),
Carthage was still the scene of many displays of savage brutality,
though Thrasamund built new baths and a basilica. Ultimately
Gelimer, the last Vandal king, was defeated at Ad Decimum by
the Byzantine army under Belisarius, who entered Carthage
unopposed (September 14, 533). The restored city now received
the name of Colonia Justiniana Carthago; Belisarius rebuilt the
walls and entrusted the government to Solomon. New basilicas
and other monuments were erected, and Byzantine Carthage recovered
for a century the prosperity of the Roman city.</p>

<p>At length the Arabs, having conquered Cyrenaica and Tripolitana
(647), and founded Kairawan (670), arrived before
Carthage. In 697 Hasan ibn en-Noman, the Gassanid governor
of Egypt, captured the city almost without resistance. But
the garrison left by the Arabs was quite unable to defend itself
against the patrician Joannes, who retook the city and hastily
put it in a state of defence. Hasan returned furious with anger,
defeated the Byzantines again, and decreed the entire destruction
of the city. His orders were fulfilled; and in 698 Carthage
finally disappears from history. Once again only does the name
appear in the middle ages, when the French king, Louis IX., at
the head of the eighth crusade, disembarked there on the 17th of
July 1270. He died, however, of the plague on the 25th of August
without having recovered northern Africa for civilization.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARTHAGE<a name="ar82" id="ar82"></a></span>, a city and the county-seat of Jasper county,
Missouri, U.S.A., on the Spring river, about 950 ft. above sea-level,
and about 150 m. S. by E. of Kansas City. Pop. (1890)
7981; (1900) 9416, of whom 539 were negroes; (1910 census)
9483. It is served by the St. Louis &amp; San Francisco, the
Missouri Pacific, and the St. Louis, Iron Mountain &amp; Southern
railways, and is connected with Webb City and Joplin, Mo.,
and Galena, Kan., by the electric line of the Southwest Missouri
railway. The town is built on high ground underlain by solid
limestone, and has much natural and architectural beauty. It
is the seat of the Carthage Collegiate Institute (Presbyterian).
A Chautauqua assembly and a county fair are held annually.
In the vicinity there are valuable lead, zinc and coal mines, and
quarries of Carthage &ldquo;marble,&rdquo; with which the county court
house is built. Carthage is a jobbing centre for a fruit and grain
producing region; live-stock (especially harness horses) is raised
in the vicinity; and among the city&rsquo;s manufactures are lime,
flour, canned fruits, furniture, bed springs and mattresses,
mining and quarrying machinery, ploughs and woollen goods.
In 1905 the factory products were valued at $1,179,661. Natural
gas for domestic use and for factories is piped from the Kansas
gas fields. The municipality owns and operates the electric-lighting
plant. Carthage, founded in 1833, was laid out as a
town and became the county-seat in 1842, was incorporated
as a town in 1868, was chartered as a city in 1873, and in 1890
became a city of the third class under the general (state) law.
On the 5th of July 1861 about 3500 Confederates under General
James E. Rains and M.M. Parsons, accompanied by Governor
Claiborne Fox Jackson (1807-1862), and 1500 Union troops
under Colonel Franz Sigel, were engaged about 7 m. north of the
city in an indecisive skirmish which has been named the battle
of Carthage.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CARTHAGE, SYNODS OF<a name="ar83" id="ar83"></a></span>. During the 3rd, 4th, and 5th
centuries the town of Carthage (<i>q.v.</i>) in Africa served as the
meeting-place of a large number of church synods, of which,
however, only the most important can be treated here.</p>

<p>1. In May 251 a synod, assembled under the presidency of
Cyprian to consider the treatment of the <i>lapsi</i> (those who had
fallen away from the faith during persecution), excommunicated
Felicissimus and five other Novatian bishops (Rigorists), and
declared that the <i>lapsi</i> should be dealt with, not with indiscriminate
severity, but according to the degree of individual guilt.
These decisions were confirmed by a synod of Rome in the
autumn of the same year. Other Carthaginian synods concerning
the <i>lapsi</i> were held in 252 and 254.</p>

<div class="condensed">

sqq.); Mansi, i. pp. 863 sqq., 905 sqq.; Hardouin, i. pp. 133 sqq.,
147 sqq.; Cyprian, <i>Epp.</i> 52, 54, 55, 68.</p>
</div>

<p>2. Two synods, in 255 and 256, held under Cyprian, pronounced
against the validity of heretical baptism, thus taking
direct issue with Stephen, bishop of Rome, who promptly
repudiated them, and separated himself from the African
Church. A third synod, September 256, unanimously reaffirmed
the position of the other two. Stephen&rsquo;s pretensions to authority
as &ldquo;bishop of bishops&rdquo; were sharply resented, and for some
time the relations of the Roman and African Churches were
severely strained.</p>

Cyprian, <i>Epp.</i> 69-75.</p>
</div>

<p>3. The Donatist schism (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Donatists</a></span>) occasioned a number
of important synods. About 348 a synod of Catholic bishops,
who had met to record their gratitude for the effective official repression
of the &ldquo;Circumcelliones&rdquo; (Donatist terrorists), declared
against the rebaptism of any one who had been baptized in the
name of the Trinity, and adopted twelve canons of clerical
discipline.</p>

184-186); Mansi, iii. pp. 143 sqq.; Hardouin, i. pp. 683 sqq.</p>
</div>

<p>4. The &ldquo;Conference of Carthage&rdquo; (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Donatists</a></span>), held by
imperial command in 411 with a view to terminating the Donatist
schism, while not strictly a synod, was nevertheless one of the
most important assemblies in the history of the African church,
and, indeed of the whole Christian church.</p>

445-446); Mansi, iv. pp. 7-283; Hardouin, i. pp. 1043-1190.</p>
</div>

<p>5. On the 1st of May 418 a great synod (&ldquo;A Council of Africa,&rdquo;
St Augustine calls it), which assembled under the presidency of
Aurelius, bishop of Carthage, to take action concerning the
errors of Caelestius, a disciple of Pelagius (<i>q.v.</i>), denounced the
Pelagian doctrines of human nature, original sin, grace and
perfectibility, and fully approved the contrary views of Augustine.
Prompted by the reinstatement by the bishop of Rome of a
deposed African priest, the synod enacted that &ldquo;whoever
appeals to a court on the other side of the sea (meaning Rome)
may not again be received into communion by any one in Africa&rdquo;
(canon 17).</p>

Hardouin, i. pp. 926 sqq.</p>
</div>

<p>6. The question of appeals to Rome occasioned two synods,
one in 419, the other in 424. The latter addressed a letter to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page432" id="page432"></a>432</span>
the bishop of Rome, Celestine, protesting against his claim to
appellate jurisdiction, and urgently requesting the immediate
recall of his legate, and advising him to send no more judges to
Africa.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CARTHUSIANS,<a name="ar84" id="ar84"></a></span> an order of monks founded by St Bruno (<i>q.v.</i>).
In 1084 Bruno and his six companions presented themselves
before the bishop of Grenoble and explained to him their desire
to lead an ascetical life in a solitary place. He pointed out to
them a desolate spot named Chartreuse, on the mountains near
Grenoble, rocky and precipitous, and snow-covered during a
great portion of the year, and told them they might there carry
out their design. They built themselves three huts and an
oratory, and gave themselves up to a life of prayer and silence
and extreme austerity. After a few years Bruno was summoned
to Rome by Urban II., as an adviser in the government of the
Church, c. 1090; but after a year or so he obtained permission
to withdraw from Rome, and was able to found in the forests of
Calabria near Squillace a second, and later on a third and a fourth
monastery, on the same lines as the Chartreuse. On one of these
south Italian foundations Bruno died in 1101. On leaving the
Chartreuse he had appointed a successor as superior, and the
institute steadily took more settled shape and further development.
Peter the Venerable, abbot of Cluny, writing about
forty years later, speaks thus of the mode of life of the earliest
Carthusians:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;Warned by the negligence and lukewarmness of many of the
older monks, they adopted for themselves and for their followers
greater precaution against the artifices of the Evil One. As
remedy against pride and vain-glory they chose a dress more poor
and contemptible than that of any other religious body; so that it
is horrible to look on these garments, so short, scanty, coarse and
dirty are they. In order to cut up avarice by the roots, they enclosed
around their cells a certain quantity of land, more or less,
according to the fertility of the district; and they would not accept
a foot of land beyond that limit if you were to offer them the whole
world. For the same motive they limit the quantity of their cattle,
oxen, asses, sheep and goats. And in order that they might have
no motive for augmenting their possessions, either of land or animals,
they ordained that in every one of their monasteries there should
be no more than twelve monks, with their prior the thirteenth,
eighteen lay brothers and a few paid servants. To mortify the
flesh they always wear hair shirts of the severest kind, and their
fasting is wellnigh continuous. They always eat bread of unbolted
meal, and take so much water with their wine that it has hardly
any flavour of wine left. They never eat meat, whether in health
or ill. They never buy fish, but they accept it if it is given to them
for charity. They may eat cheese and eggs only on Sundays and
Thursdays. On Tuesdays and Saturdays they eat cooked vegetables.
On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays they take only bread and
water. They eat once a day only, save during the octaves of
Christmas, Easter, Pentecost, Epiphany and other solemnities.
They live in separate little houses like the ancient monks of Egypt,
and they occupy themselves continually with reading, prayer and
the labour of their hands, especially the writing of books. They
recite the prayers for minor canonical hours in their own dwellings,
when warned by the bell of the church; but they all assemble in
church for matins and vespers. On feast days they eat twice, and
sing all the offices in the church, and eat in the refectory. They
do not say mass save on festivals and Sundays. They boil the
vegetables served out to them in their own dwellings, and never
drink wine save with their food.&rdquo; (Migne, <i>Patrol. Lat.</i> clxxxix. 943.)</p>
</div>

<p>In its broad outlines this description of primitive Carthusian
life has remained true, even to the present day: the regulations
as to food are not quite so stringent, and the habit is now an
ordinary religious habit of white serge. It was not until 1170
that the Carthusians were formally constituted a separate
religious order by papal act. Owing to its very nature, the
institute never had any great expansion: at the middle of the
13th century there were some 50 Charterhouses; at the beginning
of the 18th there were 170, 75 being in France.</p>

<p>There was no written rule before 1130, when Guigo, the
fifth prior of the Grande Chartreuse, reduced to writing the
body of customs that had been the basis of Carthusian life
(Migne, <i>Patrol. Lat.</i> cliii. 631); enlargements and modifications
of this code were made in 1259, 1367, 1509 and 1681: this last
form of the statutes is the present Carthusian rule.</p>

<p>The life is very nearly eremitical: except on Sundays and
feasts, the Carthusians meet only three times a day in the
church&mdash;for the Midnight Office, for Mass and for Vespers;
once a week, on Sundays (and feasts) they have their meal in
the refectory, and once a week they have recreation together
and a walk outside enclosure. All the rest of their time is passed
in solitude in their hermitages, which are built quite separate
from one another. Each hermitage is a house, containing
living-room, bedroom and oratory, workshop and store-room,
and has a small garden attached. The monks are supplied with
such tools as they wish to employ in workshop and garden, and
with such books as they need from the library. The Carthusian
goes to bed every evening at 7 and is called about 11, when
he says in his private oratory the <i>Officium B. Mariae Virginis</i>.
Towards midnight all repair to the church for Matins and Lauds,
which are celebrated with extraordinary solemnity and prolixity,
so as to last from 2 to 3 hours, according to the office. They
then return to bed until 5, when they again go to the church for
the daily High Mass, still celebrated according to the phase of
liturgical and ritual development of the 11th century. The
private Masses are then said, and the monks betake themselves
to work or study. At 10 in summer, 11 in winter, 12 on feast
days, they have their dinner, alone except on Sundays and feasts;
the dinner is supplied from the common kitchen through a small
window. On many days of the year there is but one meal;
meat is never eaten, even in sickness&mdash;this has always been an
absolute rule among the Carthusians. In the afternoon they
again assemble in the church for Vespers; the lesser portions
of the canonical office, as well as the Office of the Blessed Virgin
and the Office of the Dead, are said privately in the oratories.</p>

<p>This manner of life has been kept up almost without variation
for eight centuries: among the Carthusians there have never
been any of those revivals and reforms that are so striking a
feature in the history of other orders&mdash;&ldquo;never reformed, because
never deformed.&rdquo; The Carthusians have always lived thus
wholly cut off from the outer world, each one in almost entire
isolation. They introduced and have kept up in western
Europe a life resembling that of the early Egyptian monks,
as under St Anthony&rsquo;s guidance monasticism passed from the
utter individualism of the first hermits to the half eremitical,
half cenobitical life of the Lauras (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Monasticism</a></span>). Owing
to certain resemblances in external matters to the Benedictine
rule and practice, the Carthusians have sometimes been regarded
as one of the offshoots from the Benedictines; but this view is
not tenable, the whole Carthusian conception, idea and spirit
being quite different from the Benedictine.</p>

<p>The superiors of the Charterhouses are priors, not abbots,
and the prior of the Grande Chartreuse is the superior general
of the order. A general chapter of the priors is held annually
at the Grande Chartreuse. The Carthusians have always
flourished most in France, but they had houses all over western
Europe; some of the Italian <i>Certose</i>, as those at Pavia, Florence
and Naples, are renowned for their wonderful beauty.</p>

<p>The first English Charterhouse was established in 1178 at
Witham by Selwood Forest, and at the Dissolution there were
nine, the most celebrated being those at Sheen in Surrey and at
Smithfield in London (for list see <i>Catholic Dictionary</i>, art. &ldquo;Carthusians&rdquo;).
The Carthusians were the only order that made
any corporate resistance to the ecclesiastical policy of Henry
VIII. The community of the London Charterhouse stood firm,
and the prior and several of the monks were put to death in
1535 under circumstances of barbarous cruelty. In Mary&rsquo;s
reign a community was reassembled at Sheen, and on her
death it emigrated, fifteen in number, to Flanders, and finally
settled in Nieuport; it maintained itself as an English community
for a considerable time, but gradually dwindled, and the last of
the old English Carthusian stock died in 1831. There is now one
Charterhouse in England established at Parkminster in Sussex
in 1883; the community numbers 50 choir-monks, but it is
almost wholly made up of foreigners, including many of those
recently expelled from France.</p>

<p>At the French Revolution the monks were driven from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page433" id="page433"></a>433</span>
Grande Chartreuse, but they returned in 1816; they were again
driven out under the Association Laws of 1901, and the community
of the Grande Chartreuse is now settled in an old Certosa
near Lucca. Of late years the community at the Grande
Chartreuse had consisted of some 40 choir-monks and 20 lay
brothers. Before the recent expulsions from France there were
in all some 20 Charterhouses.</p>

<p>There have been since the middle of the 13th century a very
few convents of Carthusian nuns, not more than ten; in recent
times there have been but two or three, one situated a few miles
from the Grande Chartreuse. The rule resembles that of the
monks, but the isolation, solitude and silence are much less
stringent. The habit of the Carthusians, both monks and nuns,
is white.</p>

<p>A word may be added as to the famous liqueur, known as
Chartreuse, made by the monks. At the Revolution the property
of the Carthusians was confiscated, and on their restoration they
recovered only the barren desert in which the monastery stood,
and for it they had to pay rent. Thus they were for some years
in want even of the needful means of subsistence. Then the
liqueur was invented as a means of supplying the wants of the
community; it became a great commercial success and produces
a large yearly income. This income the monks have not spent
on themselves, nor does it accumulate. The first charge is the
maintenance of the Grande Chartreuse and the other Charterhouses,
and out of it have been built and established the new
monasteries of the order, as at Düsseldorf, Parkminster and
elsewhere; but by far the largest portion has been spent on
religious and charitable purposes in France and all over the world,&mdash;churches,
schools, hospitals, almshouses, foreign missions.
One thing is certain: the profits made no difference at all to
the secluded and austere life of the monks of the Grande
Chartreuse.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARTIER, SIR GEORGES ÉTIENNE,<a name="ar85" id="ar85"></a></span> Bart. (1814-1873),
Canadian statesman, was born in the province of Quebec on the
6th of September 1814. Called to the bar in 1835, he soon
gained a large practice. He took part in the rebellion of 1837,
and was forced for a time to fly the country. In 1848 he was
elected to the Canadian parliament. His youthful ebullition
of 1837 was soon repented of, and he became a loyal subject of
the British crown. So greatly had he changed that in 1854
he became a leading member of the reconstructed Liberal-Conservative
party. In 1855 he was appointed provincial
secretary, and in 1857 attorney-general for Lower Canada.
From 1858 to 1862 he and Sir John Macdonald were joint prime
ministers of Canada, and their alliance lasted till the death of
Cartier. He took the chief part in promoting many useful
measures, such as the abolition of seigneurial tenure in Lower
Canada (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Quebec</a></span>), and the codification of the civil law of
that province (1857-1864). Above all he favoured the construction
of railways, and to his energy and fearless, optimism
are largely due the eventual success of the Grand Trunk railway,
and the resolve to construct the Canadian Pacific. In the face
of great opposition, he carried his native province into federation
(1864-1867), which would have been impossible without his aid.
In the first cabinet of Sir John Macdonald he sat as minister of
militia and defence, and carried in 1868 an important act establishing
the land forces of Canada on a sound basis. Though a
devout Catholic, he became involved in a political quarrel with
his church, and was defeated by clerical influence at the general
election of 1872. Another seat was found for him, but his health
failed and he died on the 20th of May 1873.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CARTIER, JACQUES<a name="ar86" id="ar86"></a></span> (1491-1557), French navigator, discoverer
of the Canadian river St Lawrence, was born at St Malo
in Brittany. Of his early life nothing is known. On the suppression
by Admiral Chabot of the trade to Brazil, an expedition
consisting of two ships and sixty-one men was despatched from
St Malo under Cartier on the 20th of April 1534, to look for a
north-west passage to the East. Cartier reached Newfoundland
on the 10th of May, and at once entered the strait of Belle Isle,
then known to the fishermen as the bay of Castles. While the
ships renewed their supply of wood and water in Belles Amours
harbour on the north side of the strait, the long-boats discovered
that the coast farther west was barren, rocky and uninviting.
In view of this Cartier set sail on Monday, the 15th of June, for
the south side of the strait, by following which he was led down
almost the whole west coast of Newfoundland. Off St George&rsquo;s
Bay a storm drove the ships out into the gulf, but on resuming
his course Cartier fell in with the Bird Rocks. The island south
of these he named Brion Island, after Chabot. Cartier mistook
our Magdalen and Prince Edward Islands for the main shore on
the south side of this inland sea. Following the coast of New
Brunswick northward he was greatly disappointed to discover
Chaleur Bay was not a strait. During a ten days&rsquo; stay in Gaspé
Harbour Cartier made friends with a tribe of Huron-Iroquois
Indians from Quebec, two of whom he carried off with him. A
mirage deceived him into thinking the passage up the river south
of Anticosti was a bay, whereupon he proceeded to coast the
southern, eastern and northern shores of Anticosti. On discovering
the passage between this island and the Quebec shore
a council was held, at which it was decided to postpone the
exploration of this strait until the following year. Heading
eastward along the Quebec shore, Cartier soon regained the Strait
of Belle Isle and, entering the Atlantic on the 15th of August,
reached St Malo in safety on the 5th of September.</p>

<p>Cartier set sail again from St Malo with three vessels on the
16th of May 1536, and passing through the strait of Belle Isle
anchored on the 9th of August in Pillage Bay, opposite Anticosti.
The next day he named this the bay of St Lawrence. In course
of time the name spread to the gulf and finally to the river.
Proceeding through the passage north of Anticosti, Cartier
anchored on the 1st of September at the mouth of the Saguenay,
which the two Indians who had passed the winter in France
informed him was the name of a kingdom &ldquo;rich and wealthy
in precious stones.&rdquo; Again on reaching the island of Orleans,
so named after the third son of Francis I., they told Cartier he
was now in the kingdom of Canada, in reality the Huron-Iroquois
word for village. Leaving his two larger vessels in the St Charles,
which there enters the St Lawrence, Cartier set off westward
with the bark and the long-boats. The former grounded in Lake
St Peter, but in the latter he reached, on the 2nd of October,
the Huron-Iroquois village of Hochelaga on the site of the city
of Montreal. Further progress was checked by the Lachine
Rapid. From the top of Mount Royal, a name still in use,
Cartier beheld the St Lawrence and the Ottawa stretching away
to the west. On his return to the St Charles, where during the
winter twenty-five men died of scurvy, Cartier sought further
information about the rich country called Saguenay, which he
was informed could be reached more easily by way of the
Ottawa. In order to give Francis I. authentic information of
this northern Mexico, Cartier seized the chief and eleven of the
headmen of the village and carried them off to France. This
time he passed south of Anticosti and, entering the Atlantic
through Cabot Strait, reached St Malo on the 16th of July
1537.</p>

<p>Francis I. was unable to do anything further until the spring
of 1541, when Cartier set sail with five vessels and took up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page434" id="page434"></a>434</span>
his quarters at Cap Rouge, 9 m. above Quebec. A soldier, the
seigneur de Roberval, had been chosen to lead the men to the
conquest of Saguenay; but when he did not arrive, Cartier made
a fresh examination of the rapid of Lachine, preparatory to
sending the men up the river Ottawa. Roberval at length set
sail in April 1542, but on reaching St John&rsquo;s, Newfoundland, met
Cartier on his way back to France. In the summer of 1543,
Cartier was sent out to bring home Roberval, whose attempt to
make his way up the Ottawa to this mythical Saguenay had
proved futile. From 1544 until his death at St Malo, on the 1st
of September 1557, Cartier appears to have done little else than
give technical advice in nautical matters and act as Portuguese
interpreter.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARTOON<a name="ar88" id="ar88"></a></span> (Ital. <i>cartone</i>, pasteboard), a term used in pictorial
art in two senses, (1) In painting, a cartoon is used as a model
for a large picture in fresco, oil or tapestry, or for statuary.
It was also formerly employed in glass and mosaic work. When
cartoons are used in fresco-painting, the back of the design is
covered with black-lead or other colouring matter; and, this
side of the picture being applied to the wall, the artist passes over
the lines of the design with a point, and thus obtains an impression.
According to another method the outlines of the figures are
pricked with a needle, and the cartoon, being placed against the
wall, is &ldquo;pounced,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> a bag of black colouring-matter is drawn
over the perforations, and the outlines are thus transferred to the
wall. In fresco-painting, the portions of the cartoon containing
figures were formerly cut out and fixed (generally in successive
sections) upon the moist plaster. Their contour was then traced
with a pointed instrument, and the outlines appeared lightly
incised upon the plaster after the portion of the cartoon was
withdrawn. In the manufacture of tapestries upon which it
is wished to give a representation of the figures of cartoons, these
figures are sometimes cut out, and laid behind or under the woof,
to guide the operations of the artist. In this case the cartoons
are coloured.</p>

<p>Cartoons have been executed by some of the most distinguished
masters; the greatest extant performances in this line of art
are those of Raphael. They are seven in number, coloured in
distemper; and at present they adorn the Victoria and
Albert Museum, in South Kensington, having been removed
thither from their former home, the palace of Hampton Court.
With respect to their merits, they count among the best of
Raphael&rsquo;s productions; Lanzi even pronounces them to be in
beauty superior to anything else the world has ever seen. Not that
they all present features of perfect loveliness, and limbs of
faultless symmetry,&mdash;this is far from being the case; but in
harmony of design, in the universal adaptation of means to one
great end, and in the grasp of soul which they display, they stand
among the foremost works of the designing art. The history of
these cartoons is curious. Leo X. employed Raphael in designing
(in 1515-1516) a series of Scriptural subjects, which were
first to be finished in cartoons, and then to be imitated in tapestry
by Flemish artists, and used for the decoration of the Sistine
Chapel. Two principal sets of tapestries were accordingly
executed at Arras in Flanders; but it is supposed that neither
Leo nor Raphael lived to see them. The set which went to Rome
was twice carried away by invaders, first in 1527 and afterwards in
1798. In the first instance they were restored in a perfect state;
but after their return in 1814 one was wanting&mdash;the cupidity of
a Genoese having induced him to destroy it for the sake of
the precious metal which it contained. Authorities differ as
to the original number of cartoons, but there appear to have
been twenty-five,&mdash;some by Raphael himself, assisted by Gianfrancesco
Penni, others by the surviving pupils of Raphael.
The cartoons after which the tapestries were woven were not,
it would seem, restored to Rome, but remained as lumber
about the manufactory in Arras till after the revolution of the
Low Countries, when seven of them which had escaped destruction
were purchased by Charles I., on the recommendation of
Rubens. They were found much injured, &ldquo;holes being pricked
in them for the weavers to pounce the outlines, and in other parts
they were almost cut through by tracing.&rdquo; It has never been
ascertained what became of the other cartoons. Three tapestries,
the cartoons of which by Raphael no longer exist, are in the
Vatican,&mdash;representing the stoning of St Stephen, the conversion
of St Paul, and St Paul in prison at Philippi.</p>

<p>Besides the cartoons of Raphael, two, to which an extraordinary
celebrity in art-history attaches, were those executed in
competition by Leonardo da Vinci and by Michelangelo&mdash;the
former named the Battle of the Standard, and the latter the
Cartoon of Pisa&mdash;soldiers bathing, surprised by the approach of
the enemy. Both these great works have perished, but the
general design of them has been preserved. In recent times
some of the most eminent designers of cartoons have been masters
of the German school,&mdash;Cornelius, Kaulbach, Steinle, Fuhrich,
&amp;c.; indeed, as a general rule, these artists appear to greater
advantage in their cartoons than in the completed paintings of
the same compositions. In England cartoon-work developed considerably
in 1843 and 1844, when a competition was held for the
decoration of the new Houses of Parliament. Dyce and Maclise
left examples of uncommon mark in this line. The cartoon by
Fred. Walker, A.R.A., made to advertise the dramatic version of
Wilkie Collins&rsquo;s <i>Woman in White</i>, is now at the Tate Gallery; and
cartoons by Ford Madox Brown are in the Victoria and Albert
Museum, South Kensington.</p>
<div class="author">(W. M. R.)</div>

<p>(2) &ldquo;Cartoon&rdquo; is also a term now applied to the large political
drawings in the humorous or satirical papers of the day. At an
earlier period satirical prints were styled &ldquo;caricatures,&rdquo; and were
issued separately. Gillray, Rowlandson, the three Cruikshanks,
Heath and others were popular favourites in this class of design.
Even the insignificant little cuts by Robert Seymour in <i>Figaro in
London</i>, the <i>diableries</i> in <i>The Fly</i>, and the vulgar and rancorous
political skits identified with the flood of scurrilous little papers of
the time, were dignified by the same term. The long series of
<i>Political Sketches</i> by &ldquo;H.B.&rdquo; (John Doyle) were the first examples
of unexaggerated statement, and fair and decorous
satire. With the advent of <i>Punch</i> and its various rivals (<i>The
Peep-Show, The Great Gun, Diogenes</i> and the like), the general
tone was elevated. <i>Punch</i> at first adopted the word &ldquo;pencilling&rdquo;
to describe the &ldquo;big cut,&rdquo; which dealt variously with political
and social topics. But when in 1843 there was held in Westminster
Hall the great exhibition of &ldquo;cartoons&rdquo; from which
selection was to be made of designs for the decoration in fresco of
the new Houses of Parliament, <i>Punch</i> jocularly professed to
range himself alongside the great artists of the day; so that the
&ldquo;mad designe&rdquo; of the reign of Charles I. became the &ldquo;cartoon&rdquo;
of that of Queen Victoria. John Leech&rsquo;s drawing in No. 105 of
that journal was the first caricature to be called a cartoon: it was
entitled &ldquo;Substance and Shadow: the Poor ask for Bread, and
the Philanthropy of the State accords&mdash;an Exhibition.&rdquo; Later,
<i>Punch</i> dropped the word for a while, but the public took it up.
Yet the <i>New English Dictionary</i> curiously attributes the first use of
it to Miss Braddon in 1863.</p>

<p>In England the cartoon, no longer a weapon of venomous
attack, has come to be regarded as a humorous or sarcastic
comment upon the topic uppermost in the nation&rsquo;s mind, a witty
or saturnine illustration of views already formed, rather than as
an instrument for the manufacture of public opinion. It has
almost wholly lost its rancour; it has totally lost its ferocity&mdash;the
evolutionary result of peace and contentment, for satire in its
more violent and more spontaneous form is but the outcome of
the dissatisfaction or the rage of the multitude. The cartoon, it is
agreed, must be suggestive; it must present a clear idea lucidly
and, if possible, laughably worked out; and, however reserved
or restrained it may be, or even, when occasion demands (as in
the case of Sir John Tenniel and some of his imitators), however
epic in intuition, it must always figure, so to say, as a leading

<p><span class="bold">CARTOUCHE<a name="ar89" id="ar89"></a></span> (a French word adapted from the Ital. <i>cartoccio,</i>
a roll of paper, Med Lat. <i>carta</i>, for <i>charta</i>, paper), originally a
roll of paper, parchment or other material, containing the charge
of powder and shot for a firearm, a cartridge (<i>q.v.</i>), which itself is a
corruption of cartouche. The term was applied in architecture to
various forms of ornamentation taking the shape of a scroll, such
as the volute of an Ionian capital. It was particularly used of a
sculptured tablet in the shape of a partly unrolled scroll on
which could be placed an inscription or device. Such &ldquo;cartouches&rdquo;
are used for titles, &amp;c., on engravings of maps, plans,
and the like. The arms of the popes and ecclesiastics of high
birth were borne on an oval cartouche; and it is thus particularly
applied, in Egyptian archaeology, for the oblong device with
oval ends, enclosing the names of royal personages on the
monuments. It is properly an oval formed by a rope knotted at
one end. An amulet of similar shape, as the symbol of the
&ldquo;name,&rdquo; was worn by men and women as a protection against
the blotting out of the name after death.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARTWRIGHT, EDMUND<a name="ar91" id="ar91"></a></span> (1743-1823), English inventor,
younger brother of Major John Cartwright (<i>q.v.</i>), was born at
Marnham, Nottinghamshire, on the 24th of April 1743, and
educated at Wakefield grammar school. He began his academical
studies at University College, Oxford, and in 1764 he was elected
to a fellowship at Magdalen. In 1770 he published <i>Armine and
Elvira,</i> a legendary poem, which was followed in 1779 by <i>The
Prince of Peace</i>. In 1779 he was presented to the rectory of
Goadby Marwood, Leicestershire, to which in 1786 was added
a prebend in the cathedral of Lincoln. He took the degree
of D.D. at Oxford in 1806. He would probably have passed
an obscure life as a country clergyman had not his attention
been accidentally turned in 1784 to the possibility of applying
machinery to weaving. The result was that he invented a power-loom,
for which he took out a patent in 1785; it was a rude
contrivance, though it was improved by subsequent patents
in 1786 and 1787, and gradually developed into the modern
power-loom. Removing to Doncaster in 1785, he started a
weaving and spinning factory; it did not, however, prove a
financial success, and in 1793 he had to surrender it to his
creditors. A mill at Manchester, in which a number of his
machines were installed, was wilfully destroyed by fire in 1791.
In 1789 he patented a wool-combing machine, for which he took
out further patents in 1790 and 1792; it effected large economies
in the cost of manufacture, but its financial results were not
more satisfactory to its inventor than those of the power-loom,
even though in 1801 parliament extended the patent for fourteen
years. In 1807 a memorial was presented to the government
urging the benefits that had been conferred on the country by
the power-loom, and the House of Commons voted him £10,000
in 1809. He then purchased a small farm at Hollander, near
Sevenoaks, Kent, where he spent the rest of his life. He died
at Hastings on the 30th of October 1823. Other inventions of
Cartwright&rsquo;s included a cordelier or machine for making rope
(1792), and an engine working with alcohol (1797), together
with various agricultural implements.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CARTWRIGHT, JOHN<a name="ar92" id="ar92"></a></span> (1740-1824), English parliamentary
reformer, was born at Marnham in Nottinghamshire on the
17th of September 1740, being the elder brother of Edmund
Cartwright, inventor of the power-loom. He was educated at
Newark grammar school and Heath Academy in Yorkshire, and
at the age of eighteen entered the navy. He was present, in his
first year of service, at the capture of Cherbourg, and served in
the following year in the action between Sir Edward Hawke
and Admiral Conflans. Engaged afterwards under Sir Hugh
Palliser and Admiral Byron on the Newfoundland station, he
was appointed to act as chief magistrate of the settlement; and
the duties of this post he discharged for five years (1765-1770).
Ill-health necessitated his retirement from active service for a
time in 1771. When the disputes with the American colonies
began, he saw clearly that the colonists had right on their side,
and warmly supported their cause. At the beginning of the war
he was offered the appointment of first lieutenant to the duke of
Cumberland, which would have put him on the path of certain
promotion. But he declined to fight against the cause which
he felt to be just. In 1774 he published his first plea on behalf
of the colonists, entitled <i>American Independence the Glory and
Interest of Great Britain.</i> In the following year, when the
Nottinghamshire Militia was first raised, he was appointed
major, and in this capacity he served for seventeen years. He
was at last illegally superseded, because of his political opinions.
In 1776 appeared his first work on reform in parliament, which,
with the exception of Earl Stanhope&rsquo;s pamphlets (1774), appears
to have been the earliest publication on the subject. It was
entitled, <i>Take your Choice</i>&mdash;a second edition appearing under
the new title of <i>The Legislative Rights of the Commonalty vindicated</i>.
The task of his life was thenceforth chiefly the attainment
of universal suffrage and annual parliaments. In 1778 he conceived
the project of a political association, which took shape in
1780 as the &ldquo;Society for Constitutional Information,&rdquo; including
among its members some of the most distinguished men of the
day. From this society sprang the more famous &ldquo;Corresponding
Society.&rdquo; Major Cartwright worked unweariedly for the promotion
of reform. He was one of the witnesses on the trial of
his friends, Horne Tooke, John Thelwall and Thomas Hardy, in
1794, and was himself indicted for conspiracy in 1819. He was
found guilty in the following year, and was condemned to pay a
fine of £100. He died in London on the 23rd of September 1824.
He had married in 1780, but had no children. In 1831 a monument
from a design by Macdowell was erected to him in Burton
Crescent where he had lived.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARTWRIGHT, PETER<a name="ar93" id="ar93"></a></span> (1785-1872), American Methodist
Episcopal preacher, was born on the 1st of September 1785 in
Amherst county, Virginia. His father, a veteran of the War of
Independence, took his family to Kentucky in 1790, and lived
near Lancaster until 1793, and then until 1802 in Logan county
near the Tennessee line. Peter received little education, and was
a gambler at cards and horse-racing until 1801, when he heard
John Page preach. In June he was received into the church;
in May 1802 was licensed as a regular exhorter, becoming known
as the &ldquo;Kentucky Boy&rdquo;; in the autumn of 1802 was licensed to
form the Livingston circuit around the mouth of the Cumberland
river; in 1806 was ordained deacon by Bishop Asbury, and in
1808 presiding elder by Bishop McKendree, under whose direction
he had studied theology. He was presiding elder of the
Wabash district in 1812, and of Green river district in 1813-1816,
and, after four years on circuit in Kentucky and two as presiding
elder of the Cumberland district, was transferred in 1823 to the
Illinois conference, in which he was presiding elder of various
districts until 1869. Up to 1856 he preached some 14,600 times,
received some 10,000 persons into the church, and baptized some
12,000 persons. He died near Pleasant Plains, Sangamon county,
Illinois, on the 25th of September 1872. He was a typical backwoods
preacher, an able, vigorous speaker, and a racy writer.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARTWRIGHT, SIR RICHARD JOHN<a name="ar94" id="ar94"></a></span> (1835-&emsp;&emsp;), Canadian
statesman, was born in Kingston, Canada, on the 4th of
December 1835, son of the Rev. R.D. Cartwright, chaplain to
H.M. Forces. In 1863 he entered the Canadian parliament as a
Conservative, but soon after federation in 1867 quarrelled with
his party on the question of their financial policy, which he
considered extravagant. By 1870 the breach was complete, and
in 1873 he became finance minister of the Liberal ministry of the
Hon. Alexander Mackenzie. His honesty and economy were
undoubted, but the latter quality was sometimes pushed to
extremes. From 1878 to 1896 he was the chief financial critic on
the side of the Liberal opposition, and on the accession of Sir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page436" id="page436"></a>436</span>
Wilfrid Laurier to power in 1896 he became minister of trade
and commerce. In 1898-1899 he represented Canada on the
Anglo-American joint high commission at Quebec. In 1904
failing health led to his retirement to the senate. He acted
in Sir Wilfrid Laurier&rsquo;s absence at the Imperial Conference
1907 as acting premier.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARTWRIGHT, THOMAS<a name="ar95" id="ar95"></a></span> (c. 1535-1603), English Puritan
divine, was born in Hertfordshire. He studied divinity at St
John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, but on Mary&rsquo;s accession had to leave
the university, and found occupation as clerk to a counsellor-at-law.
On the accession of Elizabeth, he resumed his theological
studies, and was soon afterwards elected fellow of St John&rsquo;s and
later of Trinity College. In 1564 he opposed John Preston in a
theological disputation held on the occasion of Elizabeth&rsquo;s state
visit, and in the following year helped to bring to a head the
Puritan attitude on church ceremonial and organization. He
was popular in Ireland as chaplain to the archbishop of Armagh
(1565-1567), and in 1569 he was appointed Lady Margaret
professor of divinity at Cambridge; but John Whitgift, on
becoming vice-chancellor, deprived him of the post in December
1570, and&mdash;as master of Trinity&mdash;of his fellowship in September
1571. This was a natural consequence of the use which he made
of his position; he inveighed bitterly against the hierarchy and
constitution of the Anglican Church, which he compared unfavourably
with the primitive Christian organization. So keen was the
struggle between him and Whitgift that the chancellor, William
Cecil, had to intervene. After his deprivation by Whitgift,
Cartwright visited Beza at Geneva. He returned to England in
1572, and might have become professor of Hebrew at Cambridge
but for his expressed sympathy with the notorious &ldquo;Admonition
to the Parliament&rdquo; by John Field and Thomas Wilcox. To
escape arrest he again went abroad, and officiated as clergyman
to the English residents at Antwerp and then at Middelburg.
In 1576 he visited and organized the Huguenot churches of the
Channel Islands, and after revising the Rhenish version of the
New Testament, again settled as pastor at Antwerp, declining
the offer of a chair at St Andrews. In 1585 he returned without
permission to London, was imprisoned for a short time, and
became master of the earl of Leicester&rsquo;s hospital at Warwick.
In 1590 he was summoned before the court of high commission
and imprisoned, and in 1591 he was once more committed to the
Fleet. But he was not treated harshly, and powerful influence
soon secured his liberation. He visited Guernsey (1595-1598),
and spent his closing years in honour and prosperity at Warwick,
where he died on the 27th of December 1603. Cartwright was a
man of much culture and originality, but exceedingly impulsive.
His views were distinctly Presbyterian, and he stoutly opposed
the Brownists or Independents. He never conceived of a separation
between church and state, and would probably have refused
to tolerate any Nonconformity with his reformed national Presbyterian
church. To him, however, the Puritanism of his day
owed its systematization and much of its force.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CARTWRIGHT, WILLIAM<a name="ar96" id="ar96"></a></span> (1611-1643), English dramatist
and divine, the son of a country gentleman who had been reduced
to keeping an inn, was born at Northway, Gloucestershire, in
1611. Anthony à Wood, whose notice of Cartwright is in the
nature of a panegyric, gives this account of his origin, which is
probably correct, although it is contradicted by statements made
in David Lloyd&rsquo;s <i>Memoirs</i>. He was educated at the free school
of Cirencester, at Westminster school, and at Christ Church,
Oxford, where he took his M.A. degree in 1635. He became, says
Wood, &ldquo;the most florid and seraphical preacher in the university,&rdquo;
and appears to have been no less admired as a reader
in metaphysics. In 1642 he was made succentor of Salisbury
cathedral, and in 1643 he was chosen junior proctor of the university.
He died on the 29th of November of the same year.
Cartwright was a &ldquo;son&rdquo; of Ben Jonson and an especial
favourite with his contemporaries. The collected edition of his
poems (1651) contains commendatory verses by Henry Lawes,
who set some of his songs to music, by Izaak Walton, Alexander
Brome, Henry Vaughan and others, and the king wore mourning
on the day of his funeral. His plays are, with the exception of
<i>The Ordinary,</i> extremely fantastic in plot, and stilted and
artificial in treatment. They are: <i>The Royal Slave</i> (1636),
produced by the students of Christ Church before the king and
queen, with music by Henry Lawes; <i>The Lady Errant</i> (acted,
1635-1636; printed, 1651); <i>The Siege, or Love&rsquo;s Convert</i> (printed
1651). In <i>The Ordinary</i> (1635 ?) he produced a comedy of real
life, in imitation of Jonson, representing pot-house society. It
is reprinted in Dodsley&rsquo;s <i>Old Plays</i> (ed. Hazlitt, vol. xii.).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARUS, KARL GUSTAV<a name="ar99" id="ar99"></a></span> (1789-1869), German physiologist
and psychologist, distinguished also as an art critic and a landscape
painter, was born and educated at Leipzig. After a course
in chemistry, he began the systematic study of medicine and in
1811 became a <i>Privat docent</i>. On the subject which he selected
(comparative anatomy) no lectures had previously been given
at Leipzig, and Carus soon established a reputation as a medical
teacher. In the war of 1813 he was director of the military
hospital at Pfaffendorf, near Leipzig, and in 1814 professor to the
new medical college at Dresden, where he spent the remainder
of his life. He was made royal physician in 1827, and a privy
councillor in 1862. He died on the 28th of July 1869. In
philosophy Carus belonged to the school of Schelling, and his
works are thoroughly impregnated with the spirit of that system.
He regarded inherited tendency as a proof that the cell has a
certain psychic life, and pointed out that individual differences
are less marked in the lower than in the higher organisms. Of
his many works the most important are:&mdash;<i>Grundzuge der
vergleichenden Anatomic und Physiologie</i> (Dresden, 1828);
<i>System der Physiologie</i> (2nd ed., 1847-1849); <i>Psyche: zur
Entwickelungsgeschichte der Seele</i> (1846, 3rd ed. Stuttgart, 1860);

<p><span class="bold">CARUS, MARCUS AURELIUS,<a name="ar100" id="ar100"></a></span> Roman emperor <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 282-283,
was born probably at Narbona (more correctly, Narona) in
Illyria, but was educated at Rome. He was a senator, and had
filled various civil and military posts before he was appointed
prefect of the praetorian guards by the emperor Probus, after
whose murder at Sirmium he was proclaimed emperor by the
soldiers. Although Carus severely avenged the death of Probus,
he was himself suspected of having been an accessory to the
deed. He does not seem to have returned to Rome after his
accession, but contented himself with an announcement of the
fact to the senate. Bestowing the title of Caesar upon his sons
Carinus and Numerianus, he left Carinus in charge of the western
portion of the empire, and took Numerianus with him on the
expedition against the Persians which had been contemplated by
Probus. Having defeated the Quadi and Sarmatians on the
Danube, Carus proceeded through Thrace and Asia Minor,
conquered Mesopotamia, pressed on to Seleucia and Ctesiphon,
and carried his arms beyond the Tigris. But his hopes of further
conquest were cut short by his death. One day, after a violent
storm, it was announced that he was dead. His death was variously
attributed to disease, the effects of lightning, or a wound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page437" id="page437"></a>437</span>
received in a campaign against the Huns; but it seems more
probable that he was murdered by the soldiers, who were averse
from further campaigns against Persia, at the instigation of
Arrius Aper, prefect of the praetorian guard. Carus seems to
have belied the hopes entertained of him on his accession, and
to have developed into a morose and suspicious tyrant.</p>

a constituent of the ethereal oil of <i>Origanum hirtum</i>, oil of thyme,
oil obtained from pepperwort, and wild bergamot. It may
be synthetically prepared by the fusion of cymol sulphonic
acid with caustic potash; by the action of nitrous acid on
1-methyl-2-amino-4-propyl benzene; by prolonged heating
of 5 parts of camphor with 1 part of iodine; or by heating
carvol with glacial phosphoric acid. It is extracted from
Origanum oil by means of a 10% potash solution. It is a thick
oil which sets at -20°C. to a mass of crystals of melting point 0°C,
and boiling point 236-237°C. Oxidation with ferric chloride
converts it into dicarvacrol, whilst phosphorus pentachloride
transforms it into chlorcymol.</p>

Marano (<i>q.v.</i>) or Crypto-Jew, who came to England in the reign
of Charles I. He was the first &ldquo;endenizened&rdquo; Jew in England,
and by his extensive trade with the West Indies rendered considerable
services to the Commonwealth. Besides his commercial
value to Cromwell, Carvajal was politically useful also, for he
acted as &ldquo;intelligencer.&rdquo; When Manasseh ben Israel in 1655
petitioned for the return of the Jews who had been expelled
by Edward I., Carvajal took part in the agitation and boldly
avowed his Judaism. Carvajal may be termed the founder

<p><span class="bold">CARVAJAL, LUISA DE<a name="ar103" id="ar103"></a></span> (1568-1614), Spanish missionary in
England, was born at Jaraicejo in Estremadura on the 2nd of
January 1568. Her father, Don Francisco de Carvajal, was the
head of an old and wealthy family which produced many men
of note. Her mother, Doña Maria, belonged to the powerful
house of Mendoza. Both were people of pious character. The
mother died in 1572 from a fever contracted while visiting the
poor, and the father took the disease from his wife, and died of it.
Luisa and a brother were left to the care of their grand-aunt
Maria Chacon, governess of the young children of Philip II.
On her death they passed to the care of their maternal uncle,
Francisco Hurtado de Mendoza, count of Almazan. The
count, who was named viceroy of Navarre by Philip II., was an
able public servant in whom religious zeal was carried to the
point of inhuman asceticism. His niece attracted his favour
by her manifest disposition to the religious life; she sent her
own share of dinner to the poor, ate broken meats, wore a chain
next her skin, and invited humiliation; and at the age of seventeen
she was instructed by the count to make a surrender of her
will to two female servants whom he set over her, and by whom
she was repeatedly scourged while naked, trampled upon and
otherwise ill-treated. But when Luisa came of age she refused
to enter a religious house, and decided to devote herself to the
conversion of England. The execution of the Jesuit emissary
priest, Henry Walpole, in 1596 had moved her deeply, and she
prepared herself by learning English and by the study of divinity.
A lawsuit with her brother caused temporary delay, but she
secured her share of the family fortune, which she devoted to
founding a college for English Jesuits at Louvain; it was
transferred to Watten near Saint Omer in 1612, and lasted till
the suppression of the Order. In 1605 she was allowed to go to
England. She established herself under the protection of the
Spanish ambassador, whose house was in the Barbican. From
this place of safety she carried on an active and successful propaganda.
She made herself conspicuous by her attentions to the
Gunpowder Plot prisoners, and won converts, partly by persuasion,
partly by helping women of the very poorest class in childbirth,
and taking charge of the children. Her activity attracted the
attention of the authorities, and she was arrested in 1608. But
the protection of the Spanish ambassador Zuñiga, and the desire
of King James I. to stand well with Spain, secured her release.
In 1613, while staying at a house in Spitalfields, where she had
in fact set up a disguised nunnery, she was arrested with all the
inmates by the pursuivants of Abbot, archbishop of Canterbury,
who had been on the watch for some time. Her release was again
secured by the new Spanish ambassador Gondomar, who played
with effect on the weakness of King James. By this time,
however, the Spanish authorities had begun to discover that
she was a political danger to them, and recalled her. Luisa,
who had hoped for the crown of martyrdom, was bitterly disappointed,
and resisted the order. Before she could be forced
to obey she died in the Spanish ambassador&rsquo;s house on her
birthday, the 2nd of January 1614. Her body remained as an
object of admiration for months till it was carried back to Spain.</p>

Virtudes de la Venerable Virgen Doña Luisa de Carvajal y Mendoza</i>

It is largely autobiographical, and contains some examples

<p><span class="bold">CARVER, JOHN<a name="ar104" id="ar104"></a></span> (1575?-1621), one of the &ldquo;Pilgrim Fathers,&rdquo;
first governor of the Plymouth colony in America, was born,
probably in Nottinghamshire, England, about 1575. Owing
to religious persecution at home he took refuge in Holland
about 1607, and eventually became a deacon in the church at
Leiden of which John Robinson was the pastor. In 1620 he
emigrated to America in the &ldquo;Mayflower,&rdquo; and founded the
Plymouth colony. Before leaving England he had probably
been elected governor; after the signing of the famous &ldquo;Compact&rdquo;
this election was confirmed; and on the 23rd of March
1620 (1621 N.S.) Carver was re-elected for the ensuing year.
Early in April, however, he died from the effects of sunstroke.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CARVER, JONATHAN<a name="ar105" id="ar105"></a></span> (c. 1725-1780), American traveller,
was born probably in Canterbury, Connecticut. The date
usually given for his birth, 1732, is now considered too late, since
he was apparently married in 1746. In early life he followed the
trade of a shoemaker and subsequently served with the provincial
forces in the French and Indian wars. According to
his &ldquo;Journal&rdquo; he conceived the idea, after the peace of 1763,
of exploring Great Britain&rsquo;s newly acquired territory in the
north-west. He is said to have set out in 1766, journeyed westward
by way of the Straits of Mackinac and the Fox and
Wisconsin rivers to the Mississippi, viewed the Falls of
St Anthony, lived for some time among the Indians, and received
from them a grant of 100 sq. m. of territory between the Mississippi
and St Croix rivers. Returning east in 1768 by way of the
north shore of Lake Superior he proceeded in 1769 to England,
where he presented a letter of introduction to Benjamin Franklin,
and made vain efforts to interest the board of trade in his investigations.
In 1778 there was published in London what
purported to be his own narrative of his explorations under the
title of <i>Travels through the Interior Parts of North America in
the Years 1766, 1767 and 1768.</i> It had an immediate success,
was translated into French, German and Dutch, and was long
generally accepted as a truthful narrative of his travels and
observations, and as one of the highest authorities on the manners,
customs and language of the Indians of the northern Mississippi
valley. Carver died in London on the 31st of January 1780,
having married a second time in England although his first wife
was still living in America.</p>

<p>Soon after his death a new edition of the <i>Travels</i> was brought
out by the well-known Quaker physician and author, Dr John
Coakley Lettsom (1744-1815), who &ldquo;edited&rdquo; the work and
furnished a biographical introduction. Some doubt seems to
have been early entertained as to the real authorship of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page438" id="page438"></a>438</span>
work, Oliver Wolcott in 1792 writing to Jedediah Morse, the
geographer, that Carver was too unlettered to have written it,
and that in his belief the book was the work of some literary
hack. Careful investigation of Indian life and north-western
history, notably by H.R. Schoolcraft in 1823, William H.
Keating in his narrative of Major Long&rsquo;s Expedition (1824),
and Robert Greenhow in his <i>History of Oregon</i> (1844), showed
a remarkable similarity between the <i>Travels</i> and the accounts
of several French authorities, but these criticisms were scarcely
noticed by later writers. Finally Professor E.G. Bourne, in a
paper contributed to the <i>American Historical Review</i> for January
1906, proved beyond dispute that the bulk of Carver&rsquo;s alleged
narrative was merely a close paraphrase of Charlevoix&rsquo;s <i>Journal</i>,
La Hontan&rsquo;s <i>New Voyages to North America</i>, and James Adair&rsquo;s
<i>History of the American Indians.</i> Professor Bourne&rsquo;s theory
is that the entire book was probably the work of the facile
Dr Lettsom, whose personal relations with Carver are known
to have been intimate, the &ldquo;journal&rdquo; alone, which constituted
an inconsiderable part of the whole, having been, in part,
founded on Carver&rsquo;s random notes and recollections.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARVING<a name="ar106" id="ar106"></a></span>. To carve (A.S. <i>ceorfan</i>: connected with Gr.
<span class="grk" title="graphein">&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>) is to cut, whatever the material; but apart from
the domestic sense of carving meat, the word is more particularly
associated with the art of sculpture. The name of
sculptor (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sculpture</a></span>) is commonly reserved for the great
masters of the art, especially in stone and marble, while that of
carver is given to the artists or workmen who execute the subordinate
decorations of architecture. The word is also specially
applied to sculpture in ivory (<i>q.v.</i>) and its substitutes, and in
wood (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Wood-Carving</a></span>) and other soft materials (see also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Gem</a></span>.)</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CARVING AND GILDING,<a name="ar107" id="ar107"></a></span> two allied operations which formerly
were the most prominent features in the important
industry of frame-making. The craftsmen who pursued the
occupation were known as &ldquo;carvers and gilders,&rdquo; and the terms
still continue to be the recognized trade-name of frame-making,
although very little of the ornamentation of frame-work is now
accomplished by carving, and much of the so-called gilt ornament
is produced without the use of gold. The trade has to do
primarily with the frames of pictures, engravings and mirrors,
but many of the light decorative fittings of houses, finished in
&ldquo;composition&rdquo; and gilt work, are also entrusted to the carver
and gilder. Fashion in picture frames, like all fashions, fluctuates
greatly. Mouldings of the prevailing sizes and patterns are
generally manufactured in special factories, and supplied in
lengths to carvers and gilders ready for use. A large proportion
of such mouldings, especially those of a cheaper and inferior
quality, are made in Germany. What is distinctively known
as a &ldquo;German&rdquo; moulding is a cheap imitation of gilt work made
by lacquering over the surface of a white metallic foil. German
artisans are also very successful in the preparation of imitation
of veneers of rosewood, mahogany, walnut and other ornamental
woods. The more expensive mouldings are either in
wood (such as oak or mahogany), in veneers of any expensive
ornamental wood, or real gilt.</p>

<p>A brief outline of the method of making a gilt frame, enriched
with composition ornaments, may be taken as a characteristic
example of the operations of the frame-maker. The foundation
of such a frame is soft pine wood, in which a moulding of the
required size and section is roughly run. To prevent warping
the moulding is, or ought to be, made from two or more pieces
of wood glued together. The moulding is &ldquo;whitened up,&rdquo; or
prepared for gilding by covering it with repeated coatings of a
mixture of finely powdered whiting and size. When a sufficient
thickness of the whitening mixture has been applied, the whole
surface is carefully smoothed off with pumice-stone and glass-paper,
care being taken to keep the angles and curves clear and
sharp. Were a plain gilt moulding only desired, it would now
be ready for gilding; but when the frame is to be enriched
it first receives the composition ornaments. Composition, or
&ldquo;compo,&rdquo; is a mixture of fine glue, white resin, and linseed oil
well boiled together, with as much rolled and sifted whiting
added as makes the whole into a doughy mass while hot. This
composition is worked in a hot state into moulds of boxwood,
and so pressed in as to take up every ornamental detail. On its
removal from the mould all superfluous matter is trimmed away,
and the ornament, while yet soft and plastic, is laid on the
moulding, and fitting into all the curves, &amp;c., is fixed with glue.
The ornamental surface so prepared quickly sets and becomes
very hard and brittle. When very large bold ornaments are
wanted for frames of unusual size they are moulded in <i>papier
maché.</i> Two methods of laying on gold&mdash;oil-gilding and water-gilding&mdash;are
practised, the former being used for frames broken
up with enrichments. For oil-gilding the moulding is prepared
with two coats of fine thin size to fill the pores of the wood,
and afterwards it receives a coat of oil gold-size, which consists
of a mixture of boiled linseed oil and ochre. When this gold-size
is in a &ldquo;tacky&rdquo; or &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; condition, gold-leaf is laid on
and carefully pressed over and into all parts of the surface; and
when covered with a coat of finish-size the gilding is complete.
Water-gilding is applied to plain mouldings and all considerable
unbroken surfaces, and is finished either &ldquo;matt&rdquo; or burnished.
For these styles of work the mouldings are properly sized, and
after the size (which for &ldquo;matt&rdquo; is red in colour and for burnish
blue) is dry the gold is laid on with water. Matt-work is protected
with one or two coats of finish-size; but burnished gold
is finished only by polishing with an agate burnisher&mdash;no size
or water being allowed to touch such surfaces. The mitring up
of frames, the mounting and fitting up of paintings, engravings,
&amp;c., involve too many minor operations to be noticed here in
detail; but these, with the cutting and fitting of glass, cleaning
and repairing pictures and prints, and similar operations, all
occupy the attention of the carver and gilder.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARY, ALICE<a name="ar108" id="ar108"></a></span> (1820-1871), and <span class="bold">PHOEBE</span> (1824-1871),
American poets, were born at Mount Healthy, near Cincinnati,
Ohio, respectively on the 26th of April 1820 and the 4th of
September 1824. Their education was largely self-acquired,
and their work in literature was always done in unbroken companionship.
Their poems were first collected in a volume
entitled <i>Poems of Alice and Phoebe Carey</i> [<i>sic</i>] (1850). In 1850-1851
they removed to New York, where the two sisters, befriended
by Rufus W. Griswold (1815-1857), the <i>quasi-</i>dictator of American
verse, and Horace Greeley, occupied a prominent position in
literary circles. In 1868-1869 Alice Cary served for a short
time as the first president of Sorosis, the first woman&rsquo;s club
organized in New York. Alice, who was much the more voluminous
writer of the two, wrote prose sketches and novels, now
almost forgotten, and various volumes of verse, notably <i>The
Lover&rsquo;s Diary</i> (1868). Her lyrical poem, <i>Pictures of Memory</i>,
was much admired by Edgar Allan Poe. Phoebe published two
volumes of poems (1854 and 1868), but is best known as the
author of the hymn &ldquo;Nearer Home,&rdquo; beginning &ldquo;One sweetly
solemn thought,&rdquo; written in 1852. Alice died in New York City
on the 12th of February 1871, and Phoebe in Newport, Rhode
Island, on the 31st of July of the same year. The collected <i>Poetical
Works of Alice and Phoebe Cary</i> were published in Boston in 1886.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CARY, HENRY FRANCIS<a name="ar110" id="ar110"></a></span> (1772-1844), English author and
translator, was born at Gibraltar on the 6th of December 1772,
the son of a captain in the army. He was educated at the
grammar schools of Rugby, Sutton Coldfield and Birmingham,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page439" id="page439"></a>439</span>
and at Christ Church, Oxford, which he entered in 1790. He
took holy orders, and was presented in 1797 to the vicarage of
Abbott&rsquo;s Bromley in Staffordshire. This benefice he held till
his death. In 1800 he was also presented to the vicarage of
Kingsbury in Warwickshire. While still at school he had become
a regular contributor to the <i>Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, and had
published a volume of <i>Sonnets and Odes.</i> At Christ Church he
devoted much time to the study of French and Italian literature;
and the fruits of these studies appeared in the notes to his classic
translation of Dante. The version of the <i>Inferno</i> was published
in 1805, together with the original text. Soon afterwards Cary
moved to London, where he became reader at Berkeley chapel,
and subsequently lecturer at Chiswick and curate of the Savoy.
His version of the whole <i>Divina Commedia</i> did not appear till
1814. It was published at Cary&rsquo;s own expense, as the publisher
refused to undertake the risk, owing to the failure incurred over
the <i>Inferno</i>. The translation was brought to the notice of
Samuel Rogers by Thomas Moore. Rogers made some additions
to an article on it by Ugo Foscolo in the <i>Edinburgh Review.</i>
This article, and praise bestowed on the work by Coleridge in a
lecture at the Royal Institution, led to a general acknowledgment
of its merit. Gary&rsquo;s <i>Dante</i> thus gradually took its place
among standard works, passing through four editions in the
translator&rsquo;s lifetime. It has the great merits of accuracy,
idiomatic vigour and readableness; it preserves the sincerity and
vividness of the original; and, although many rivals have since
appeared in the field, it still holds an honourable place. Its
blank verse, however, cannot represent the close woven texture
and the stately music of the <i>terza rima</i> of the original. In
1824 Cary published a translation of <i>The Birds</i> of Aristophanes,
and, about 1834, of the <i>Odes</i> of Pindar. In 1826 he was appointed
assistant-librarian in the British Museum, a post which he held
for about eleven years. He resigned because the appointment
of keeper of the printed books, which should have been his in
the ordinary course of promotion, was refused him when it fell
vacant. In 1841 a crown pension of £200 a year, obtained
through the efforts of Samuel Rogers, was conferred on him.
Cary&rsquo;s <i>Lives of the early French Poets</i>, and <i>Lives of English Poets</i>
(from Johnson to Henry Kirke White), intended as a continuation
of Johnson&rsquo;s <i>Lives of the Poets</i>, were published in a collected form
in 1846. He died in London on the 14th of August 1844, and was
buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>

swollen nodes. The main axis ends in a flower (definite inflorescence),
and flower-bearing branches are borne one on each
side by which the branching is often continued (known technically
as a dichasial cyme). The flowers are regular, with four or
five sepals which are free or joined to form a tube in their lower
portion, the same number of petals, free and springing from below
the ovary, twice as many stamens, inserted with the petals,
and a pistil of two to five carpels joined to form an ovary containing
a large number of ovules on a central placenta and bearing
two to five styles; the ovary is one-celled or incompletely
partitioned at the base into three to five cells; honey is secreted
at the base of the stamens. The fruit is a capsule containing a
large number of small seeds and opening by apical teeth; the
seed contains a floury endosperm and a curved embryo.</p>

<p>Tribe II. <i>Sileneae</i>: the sepals
are joined below to form a
narrow tube, in which stand the
long claws of the petals and the
stamens, partly closing the tube
and rendering the honey inaccessible
to all but long-tongued
insects such as the larger bees and
Lepidoptera. The flowers are
often red. It includes several

Days, and in 1819 succeeded again in entering the chamber of
peers.</p>

<p>His nephew, <span class="sc">Louis de Casabianca</span> (1762-1798), entered the
French navy, served in the convoy of the French troops sent to
aid the revolted American colonies, and took part in various
naval actions off the North American coast. He became captain
in 1792, represented Corsica in the Convention, and then received
command of the <i>Orient</i>, which at the battle of the Nile bore
the flag of Admiral Brueys. When the latter was killed, Casabianca,
though badly wounded, fought the burning ship to the
end, and perished with most of the crew. His son, Giacomo
Jocante, a boy of ten years of age, refused to leave the ship and
died in trying to save his father. This heroic act was the subject
of several poems, including the well-known ballad by Mrs.
Hemans.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASABLANCA<a name="ar115" id="ar115"></a></span> (<i>Dar el Baida</i>, &ldquo;the white house&rdquo;), a seaport
on the Atlantic coast of Morocco, in 33° 27&prime; N., 7° 46&prime; W. It
is a wool and grain port for central Morocco, chiefly for the
provinces of Tadla and Shawia. Third in importance of the
towns on the Moorish coast, unimpeded by bar or serious rocks,
the roadstead is exposed to the north-west winds. There is
anchorage for steamers in 5 to 6 fathoms. Vessels were loaded
and discharged by lighters from the beach. In May 1907 the
construction began of harbour works which afford sheltered
accommodation for ships at all states of the tide. The value of
the foreign trade of the port for the period 1897-1907 was about
£750,000 a year. A railway to Ber Reshid, the first section of a
line intended to tap the rich agricultural region of which Casablanca
is the port, was opened in September 1908, being the first
railway built in Morocco. The population, about 20,000, includes
numerous foreign merchants, Franciscan and Protestant missions,
and a consular corps. Built by the Portuguese upon the site
of the once prosperous town of Anfa, which they had destroyed
in 1468, Casablanca was held by them for some time, till trouble
with the natives compelled them to abandon it. In August
1907, in consequence of the murder of a number of French and
Spanish workmen engaged on the harbour works, the town was
bombarded and occupied by the French (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Morocco</a></span>: <i>History</i>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASALE MONFERRATO,<a name="ar116" id="ar116"></a></span> a town and episcopal see of Piedmont,
Italy, in the province of Alessandria, 21 m. N.N.W. by
rail from the town of Alessandria. Pop. (1901) 18,874 (town);
31,370 (commune). It lies in the plain on the right bank of the
Po, 377 ft. above sea-level, and is a junction for Mortara, Vercelli.
Chivasso and Asti; it is also connected by steam tramways
with Alessandria, Vercelli and Montemagno. The fine Lombard
Romanesque cathedral, originally founded in 742, was rebuilt
in the early 12th century and consecrated in 1106; it suffered
from restoration in 1706, but has been brought back to its original
form. It contains some good pictures. The church of S.
Domenico is a good Renaissance edifice, and there are some fine
palaces. The church of S. Ilario is said to occupy the site of a
pagan temple, but the name of the ancient town (if any) which
occupied this site is not known. About 10 m. distant is the
Sacro Monte di Crea, with eighteen chapels on its slopes containing
terra-cotta groups of statues, resembling those at Varallo.
Casale Monferrato was given by Charlemagne to the church of
Vercelli, but obtained its liberty from Frederick I. (Barbarossa).
It was sacked by the troops of Vercelli, Alessandria and Milan
in 1215, but rebuilt and fortified in 1220. It fell under the power
of its marquises in 1292, and became the chief town of a small
state. In 1536 it passed to the Gonzagas of Mantua, who fortified
it very strongly. It has since been of considerable importance
as a fortress: it successfully resisted the Austrians in 1849, and
was strengthened in 1852. There is a large Portland cement
factory here.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASANOVA DE SEINGALT, GIOVANNI JACOPO<a name="ar118" id="ar118"></a></span> (1725-1798),
Italian adventurer, was born at Venice in 1725. His father
belonged to an ancient and even noble family, but alienated
his friends by embracing the dramatic profession early in life.
He made a runaway marriage with Zanetta Farusi, the beautiful
daughter of a Venetian shoemaker; and Giovanni was their
eldest child. When he was but a year old, his parents, taking a
journey to London, left him in charge of his grandmother,
who, perceiving his precocious and lively intellect, had him
educated far above her means. At sixteen he passed his examination
and entered the seminary of St Cyprian in Venice,
from which he was expelled a short time afterwards for some
scandalous and immoral conduct, which would have cost him his
liberty, had not his mother managed somehow to procure him a
situation in the household of the Cardinal Acquaviva. He made
but a short stay, however, in that prelate&rsquo;s establishment, all
restraint being irksome to his wayward disposition, and took
to travelling. Then began that existence of adventure and
intrigue which only ended with his death. He visited Rome,
Naples, Corfu and Constantinople. By turns journalist, preacher,
abbé, diplomatist, he was nothing very long, except <i>homme à
bonnes fortunes</i>, which profession he cultivated till the end of his
days. In 1755, having returned to Venice, he was denounced
as a spy and imprisoned. On the 1st of November 1756 he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page441" id="page441"></a>441</span>
succeeded in escaping, and made his way to Paris. Here he was
made director of the state lotteries, gained much financial
reputation and a considerable fortune, and frequented the
society of the most notable French men and women of the day.
In 1759 he set out again on his travels. He visited in turn the
Netherlands, South Germany, Switzerland&mdash;where he made the
acquaintance of Voltaire,&mdash;Savoy, southern France, Florence&mdash;-whence
he was expelled,&mdash;and Rome, where the pope gave him
the order of the Golden Spur. In 1761 he returned to Paris,
and for the next four or five years lived partly here, partly in
England, South Germany and Italy. In 1764 he was in Berlin,
where he refused the offer of a post made him by Frederick II.
He then travelled by way of Riga and St Petersburg to Warsaw,
where he was favourably received by King Stanislaus Poniatowski.
A scandal, followed by a duel, forced him to flee, and he
returned by a devious route to Paris, only to find a <i>lettre de
cachet</i> awaiting him, which drove him to seek refuge in Spain.
Expelled from Madrid in 1769, he went by way of Aix&mdash;where he
met Cagliostro&mdash;to Italy once more. From 1774, with which
year his memoirs close, he was a police spy in the service of the
Venetian inquisitors of state; but in 1782, in consequence of a
satirical libel on one of his patrician patrons, he had once more
to go into exile. In 1785 he was appointed by Count Waldstein,
an old Paris acquaintance, his librarian at the château of Dux
in Bohemia. Here he lived until his death, which probably
occurred on the 4th of June 1798.</p>

cynical, and interesting as a trustworthy picture of the morals and

<p><span class="bold">CASAS GRANDES<a name="ar119" id="ar119"></a></span> (&ldquo;Great Houses&rdquo;), a small village of
Mexico, in the state of Chihuahua, situated on the Casas Grandes
or San Miguel river, about 35 m. S. of Llanos and 150 m. N.W. of
the city of Chihuahua. The railway from Ciudad Juarez to
Terrazas passes through the town. It is celebrated for the
ruins of early aboriginal buildings still extant, about half a mile
from its present site. They are built of &ldquo;sun-dried blocks of
mud and gravel, about 22 in. thick, and of irregular length, generally
about 3 ft., probably formed and dried <i>in situ.</i>&rdquo; The walls
are in some places about 5 ft. thick, and they seem to have been
plastered both inside and outside. The principal edifice extends
800 ft. from north to south, and 250 ft. east to west; its general
outline is rectangular, and it appears to have consisted of three
separate piles united by galleries or lines of lower buildings. The
exact plan of the whole is obscure, but the apartments evidently
varied in size from mere closets to extensive courts. The walls
still stand at many of the angles with a height of from 40 to 50 ft.,
and indicate an original elevation of several storeys, perhaps six
or seven. At a distance of about 450 ft. from the main building
are the substructions of a smaller edifice, consisting of a series of
rooms ranged round a square court, so that there are seven to
each side besides a larger apartment at each corner. The age
of these buildings is unknown, as they were already in ruins at the
time of the Spanish Conquest. The whole district of Casas
Grandes is further studded with artificial mounds, from which
are excavated from time to time large numbers of stone axes,
metates or corn-grinders, and earthern vessels of various kinds.
These last have a white or reddish ground, with ornamentation
in blue, red, brown or black, and are of much better manufacture
than the modern pottery of the country. Similar ruins to those
of Casas Grandes exist near the Gila, the Salinas, and the Colorado
and it is probable that they are all the erections of one people.
Bancroft is disposed to assign them to the Moquis.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASAUBON, FLORENCE ESTIENNE MÉRIC<a name="ar120" id="ar120"></a></span> (1599-1671),
English classical scholar, son of Isaac Casaubon, was born at
Geneva on the 14th of August 1599. At an early age he joined
his father in England, and completed his education at Eton
and Oxford (B.A. 1618). His defence of his father against the
attacks of certain Catholics (<i>Pietas contra maledicos patrii
Nominis el Religionis Hostes</i>, 1621), secured him the notice and
favour of James I., who conferred upon him a prebendal stall
in Canterbury cathedral. He also vindicated his father&rsquo;s literary
reputation against certain impostors who had published, under
his name, a work on <i>The Origin of Idolatry (Vindicatio Patris
adversus Impostores</i>, 1624). During the Civil War he lived a
retired life, and after its conclusion refused to acknowledge the
authority of Cromwell, who, notwithstanding, requested him to
write an &ldquo;impartial&rdquo; history of the events of the period. In
spite of the tempting inducements held out, he declined, and also
refused the post of inspector of the Swedish universities offered
him by Queen Christina. After the Restoration, he was reinstated
in his benefice, and devoted the rest of his life to literary
work. He died at Canterbury on the 14th of July 1671. Méric
Casaubon&rsquo;s reputation was overshadowed by that of his father;
but his editions of numerous classical authors, and especially
of the <i>Meditations</i> of Marcus Aurelius (also English translation,
new ed. by W.H.D. Rouse, 1900), were highly valued. Among
his other works may be mentioned: <i>De Quatuor Linguis Commentatio</i>
(1650), <i>Of the Necessity of Reformation</i> (1664), <i>On
Credulity and Incredulity in Things natural, civil and divine</i> (1668).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASAUBON, ISAAC<a name="ar121" id="ar121"></a></span> (1550-1614), French (naturalized English)
classical scholar, was born at Geneva, on the 18th of February
1559, of French refugee parents. On the publication of the edict
of January 1562, the family returned to France and settled at
Crest in Dauphiné, where Arnaud Casaubon, Isaac&rsquo;s father,
became minister of a Huguenot congregation. Till he was nineteen,
Isaac had no other instruction than what could be given
him by his father during the years of civil war. Arnaud was
away from home whole years together in the Calvinist camp,
or the family were flying to the hills to hide from the fanatical
bands of armed Catholics who patrolled the country. Thus
it was in a cave in the mountains of Dauphiné, after the massacre
of St Bartholomew, that Isaac received his first lesson in Greek,
the text-book being Isocrates <i>ad Demonicum</i>.</p>

<p>At nineteen Isaac was sent to the Academy of Geneva, where
he read Greek under Francis Portus, a native of Crete. Portus
died in 1581, having recommended Casaubon, then only twenty-two,
as his successor. At Geneva he remained as professor of
Greek till 1596. Here he married twice, his second wife being
Florence, daughter of the scholar-printer, Henri Estienne.
Here, without the stimulus of example or encouragement, with
few books and no assistance, in a city peopled with religious
refugees, and struggling for life against the troops of the Catholic
dukes of Savoy, Casaubon made himself a consummate Greek
scholar and master of ancient learning. His great wants at
Geneva were books and the sympathy of learned associates.
He spent all he could save out of his small salary in buying
books, and in having copies made of such classics as were not
then in print. Henri Estienne, Théodore de Beza (rector of
the university and professor of theology), and Jacques Lect
(Lectius), were indeed men of superior learning. But Henri,
in those last years of his life, was no longer the Estienne of the
<i>Thesaurus</i>; he was never at home, and would not suffer his son-in-law
to enter his library. &ldquo;He guards his books,&rdquo; writes
Casaubon, &ldquo;as the griffins in India do their gold!&rdquo; Beza was
engrossed by the cares of administration, and retained, at most,
an interest for theological reading, while Lect, a lawyer and
diplomatist, had left classics for the active business of the council.
The sympathy and help which Casaubon&rsquo;s native city could
not afford him, he endeavoured to supply by cultivating the
acquaintance of the learned of other countries. Geneva, as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page442" id="page442"></a>442</span>
metropolis of Calvinism, received a constant succession of
visitors. The continental tour of the young Englishman of birth
was not complete without a visit to Geneva. It was there that
Casaubon made the acquaintance of young Henry Wotton, the
poet and diplomatist, who lodged in his house and borrowed
his money. Of more consequence to Isaac Casaubon was the
acquaintance of Richard Thomson (&ldquo;Dutch&rdquo; Thomson), fellow
of Clare College, Cambridge; for it was through Thomson that
the attention of Joseph Scaliger, settled in 1593 at Leiden,
was directed to Casaubon. Scaliger and Casaubon first exchanged
letters in 1594. Their intercourse, which was wholly
by letter, for they never met, passes through the stages of civility,
admiration, esteem, regard and culminates in a tone of the
tenderest affection and mutual confidence. Influential French
men of letters, the Protestant Jacques Bongars, the Catholic
Jacques de Thou, and the Catholic convert Philippe Canaye, sieur
du Fresne, aided him by presents of books and encouragement,
and endeavoured to get him invited, in some capacity, to France.</p>

<p>This was effected in 1596, in which year Casaubon accepted
an invitation to the university of Montpellier, with the title of
<i>conseiller du roi</i> and <i>professeur stipendié aux langues et bonnes
lettres</i>. In Montpellier he never took root. He held the professorship
there only three years, with several prolonged absences.
The hopes raised by his brilliant reception were disappointed;
he was badly treated by the authorities, by whom his salary
was only paid very irregularly, and, finally, not at all. He was
not, at any time, insensible to the attractions of teaching, and
his lectures at Montpellier were followed not only by the students,
but by men of mature age and position. But the love of knowledge
was gradually growing upon him, and he began to perceive
that editing Greek books was an employment more congenial
to his peculiar powers than teaching. At Geneva he had first
tried his hand on some notes on Diogenes Laërtius, on Theocritus
and the New Testament, the last undertaken at his father&rsquo;s
request. His début as an editor had been a complete Strabo
(1587), of which he was so ashamed afterwards that he apologized
for its crudity to Scaliger, calling it &ldquo;a miscarriage.&rdquo; This was
followed by the text of Polyaenus, an <i>editio princeps</i>, 1589; a
text of Aristotle, 1590; and a few notes contributed to Estienne&rsquo;s
editions of Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Pliny&rsquo;s <i>Epistolae</i>.
It is not till we come to his edition of Theophrastus&rsquo;s <i>Characteres</i>
(1592), that we have a specimen of that peculiar style of illustrative
commentary, at once apposite and profuse, which distinguishes
Casaubon among annotators. At the time of his
removal to Montpellier he was engaged upon what is the capital
work of his life, his edition of, and commentary on, Athenaeus.</p>

<p>In 1598 we find Casaubon at Lyons, superintending the
passage of his Athenaeus through the press, for which he had
been unable to find facilities at Montpellier. Here he lived
in the house of Méric de Vicq, <i>surintendant de la justice</i>, a Catholic,
but a man of acquirements, whose connexions were with the
circle of liberal Catholics in Paris. In the suite of De Vicq
Casaubon made a flying visit to Paris, and was presented to
Henry IV. The king was very gracious, and said something
about employing Casaubon&rsquo;s services in the &ldquo;restoration&rdquo;
of the fallen university of Paris. Full of hope he returned to
Montpellier. In January 1599, he received a summons to repair
to Paris. But the terms of the letter missive were so vague that,
though it bore the sign manual, Casaubon hesitated to act
upon it. However, he resigned his chair at Montpellier, but
instead of hastening to Paris, he lingered more than a year at
Lyons, in De Vicq&rsquo;s house, where he hoped to meet the king,
who was expected to visit the south. Nothing more was heard
about the professorship, but instead he was summoned by
De Vicq, who was then in Paris, to come to him in all haste on
an affair of importance. The business proved to be the Fontainebleau
Conference. Casaubon allowed himself to be persuaded
to sit as one of the referees who were to adjudicate on the
challenge sent to Du Plessis Mornay by Cardinal Duperron. By
so doing he placed himself in a false position, as Scaliger said:
&ldquo;Non debebat Casaubon interesse colloquio Plessiaeano; erat
asinus inter simias, doctus inter imperitos&rdquo; (<i>Scaligerana</i> 2<span class="sp">&alpha;</span>).
The issue was so contrived that the Protestant party could not
but be pronounced to be in the wrong. By concurring in the
decision, which was unfavourable to Du Plessis Mornay, Casaubon
lent the prestige of his name to a court whose verdict would
without him have been worthless, and confirmed the suspicions
already current among the Reformed churches that, like his
friend and patron, Canaye du Fresne, he was meditating abjuration.
From this time forward he became the object of the hopes
and fears of the two religious parties; the Catholics lavishing
promises, and plying him with arguments; the Reformed
ministers insinuating that he was preparing to forsake a losing
cause, and only higgling about his price. We now know enough
of Casaubon&rsquo;s mental history to know how erroneous were these
computations of his motives. But, at the time, it was not
possible for the immediate parties to the bitter controversy to
understand the intermediate position between Genevan Calvinism
and Ultramontanism to which Casaubon&rsquo;s reading of the
fathers had conducted him.</p>

<p>Meantime the efforts of De Thou and the liberal Catholics
to retain him in Paris were successful. The king repeated his
invitation to Casaubon to settle in the capital, and assigned him
a pension. No more was said about the university. The recent
reform of the university of Paris had closed its doors to all but
Catholics; and though the chairs of the Collège de France were
not governed by the statutes of the university, public opinion
ran so violently against heresy, that Henry IV. dared not appoint
a Calvinist to a chair, even if he had desired to do so. But it was
designed that Casaubon should succeed to the post of sub-librarian
of the royal library when it should become vacant,
and a patent of the reversion was made out in his favour. In
November 1604, Jean Gosselin died in extreme old age; and
Casaubon succeeded him as sub-librarian, with a salary of
400 livres in addition to his pension.</p>

<p>In Paris Casaubon remained till 1610. These ten years were
the brightest period of his life. He had attained the reputation
of being, after Scaliger, the most learned man of the age,&mdash;an
age in which learning formed the sole standard of literary merit.
He was placed above penury, though not in easy circumstances.
He had such facilities for religious worship as a Huguenot could
have, though he had to go out of the city to Hablon, and afterwards
to Charenton, for them. He enjoyed the society of men
of learning, or of men who took an interest in learned publications.
He had the best opportunities of seeing men of letters
from foreign countries as they passed through Paris. Above
all, he had ample facilities for using Greek books, both printed
and in MS., the want of which he had felt painfully at Geneva
and Montpellier, and which no other place but Paris could at
that period have supplied.</p>

<p>In spite of all these advantages we find Casaubon restless,
and ever framing schemes for leaving Paris, and settling elsewhere.
It was known that he was open to offers, and offers came to him
from various quarters,&mdash;from Nîmes, from Heidelberg, from
Sedan. His friends Lect and Giovanni Diodati wished, rather
than hoped, to get him back to Geneva. The causes of Casaubon&rsquo;s
discomfort in Paris were various, but the principal source of
uneasiness lay in his religion. The life of any Huguenot in Paris
was hardly secure at that time, for it was doubtful if the police
of the city was strong enough to protect them against any sudden
uprising of the fanatical mob, always ready to re-enact the St
Bartholomew. But Casaubon was exposed to persecution of
another sort. Ever since the Fontainebleau Conference an
impression prevailed that he was wavering. It was known
that he rejected the <i>outré</i> anti-popery opinions current in the
Reformed churches; that he read the fathers, and wished for
a church after the pattern of the primitive ages. He was given
to understand that he could have a professorship only by recantation.
When it was found that he could not be bought, he
was plied by controversy. Henry IV., who liked Casaubon
personally, made a point of getting him to follow his own example.
By the king&rsquo;s orders Duperron was untiring in his efforts
to convert him. Casaubon&rsquo;s knowledge of the fathers was that
of a scholar, Duperron&rsquo;s that of an adroit polemist; and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page443" id="page443"></a>443</span>
scholar was driven to admit that the polemist was often too
hard for him. These encounters mostly took place in the king&rsquo;s
library, over which the cardinal, in his capacity of aumonier,
exercised some kind of authority; and it was therefore impossible
for Casaubon to avoid them. On the other hand, the Huguenot
theologians, and especially Pierre du Moulin, chief pastor of the
church of Paris, accused him of conceding too much, and of
having departed already from the lines of strict Calvinistic
orthodoxy.</p>

<p>When the assassination of Henry IV. gave full rein to the
Ultramontane party at court, the obsessions of Duperron
became more importunate, and even menacing. It was now
that Casaubon began to listen to overtures which had been
faintly made before, from the bishops and the court of England.
In October 1610 he came to England in the suite of the ambassador,
Lord Wotton of Marley (brother of Casaubon&rsquo;s early friend),
an official invitation having been sent him by Richard Bancroft,
archbishop of Canterbury. He had the most flattering reception
from James I., who was perpetually sending for him to discuss
theological matters. The English bishops were equally delighted
to find that the great French scholar was an Anglican ready
made, who had arrived, by independent study of the Fathers, at
the very <i>via media</i> between Puritanism and Romanism, which
was becoming the fashion in the English Church. Casaubon,
though a layman, was collated to a prebendal stall in Canterbury,
and a pension of £300 a year was assigned him from the
exchequer. Nor were these merely paper figures. When Sir
Julius Caesar made a difficulty about payment, James sent a
note in his own hand: &ldquo;Chanceler of my excheker, I will have Mr
Casaubon paid before me, my wife, and my barnes.&rdquo; He still
retained his appointments in France, and his office as librarian.
He had obtained leave of absence for a visit to England, where
his permanent settlement was not contemplated. In order to
retain their hold upon him, the government of the queen regent
refused to allow his library to be sent over. It required a special
request from James himself to get leave for Madame Casaubon
to bring him a part of his most necessary books. Casaubon
continued to speak of himself as the servant of the regent, and
to declare his readiness to return when summoned to do so.</p>

<p>Meanwhile his situation in London gradually developed
unforeseen sources of discomfort. Not that he had any reason
to complain of his patrons, the king and the bishops. James
continued to the last to delight in his company, and to be as
liberal as the state of his finances allowed. John Overall had
received him and his whole family into the deanery of St Paul&rsquo;s,
and entertained him there for a year. Overall and Lancelot
Andrewes, then bishop of Ely, were the most learned men of
a generation in which extensive reading was more general among
the higher clergy than it has ever been since. These two were
attracted to Casaubon by congenial studies and opinions. With
the witty and learned bishop of Ely in particular Casaubon was
always happy to spend such hours as he had to spare from the
labours of the study. Andrewes took him to Cambridge, where
he met with a most gratifying reception from the notabilities
of the university. They went on together to Downham, where
Casaubon spent six weeks of the summer of 1611, in which year
he became naturalized. In 1613 he was taken to Oxford by Sir
Henry Savile, where, amid the homage and feasting of which he
was the object, his principal interest was for the MSS. treasures
of the Bodleian. The honorary degree which was offered him
he declined.</p>

<p>But these distinctions were far from compensating the serious
inconveniences of his position. Having been taken up by the
king and the bishops, he had to share in their rising unpopularity.
The courtiers looked with a jealous eye on a pensioner who
enjoyed frequent opportunities of taking James I. on his weak
side&mdash;his love of book talk&mdash;opportunities which they would
have known how to use. Casaubon was especially mortified by
Sir Henry Wotton&rsquo;s persistent avoidance of him, so inconsistent
with their former intimacy. His windows were broken by the
roughs at night, his children pelted in the streets by day. On
one occasion he himself appeared at Theobalds with a black eye,
having received a blow from some ruffian&rsquo;s fist in the street.
The historian Hallam thinks that he had &ldquo;become personally
unpopular&rdquo;; but these outrages from the vulgar seem to have
arisen solely from the cockney&rsquo;s antipathy to the Frenchman.
Casaubon, though he could make shift to read an English book,
could not speak English, any more than Mme Casaubon. This
deficiency not only exposed him to insult and fraud, but restricted
his social intercourse. It excluded him altogether from the
circle of the &ldquo;wits&rdquo;; either this or some other cause prevented
him from being acceptable in the circle of the lay learned&mdash;the
&ldquo;antiquaries.&rdquo; William Camden, the antiquary and historian,
he saw but once or twice. Casaubon had been imprudent enough
to correct Camden&rsquo;s Greek, and it is possible that the ex-head-master
of Westminster kept himself aloof in silent resentment of
Casaubon&rsquo;s superior learning. With Robert Cotton and Henry
Spelman he was slightly acquainted. Of John Selden we find
no mention. Though Sir Henry Savile ostensibly patronized
him, yet Casaubon could not help suspecting that it was Savile
who secretly prompted an attempt by Richard Montagu to
forestall Casaubon&rsquo;s book on Baronius. Besides the jealousy
of the natives, Casaubon had now to suffer the open attacks
of the Jesuit pamphleteers. They had spared him as long as
there were hopes of getting him over. The prohibition was taken
off, now that he was committed to Anglicanism. Not only
Joannes Eudaemon, Heribert Rosweyd and Scioppius (Gaspar
Schoppe),<a name="fa1f" id="fa1f" href="#ft1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a> but a respectable writer, friendly to Casaubon,
Andreas Schott of Antwerp, gave currency to the insinuation
that Casaubon had sold his conscience for English gold.</p>

<p>But the most serious cause of discomfort in his English
residence was that his time was no longer his own. He was
perpetually being summoned out of town to one or other of James&rsquo;s
hunting residences that the king might enjoy his talk. He had
come over from Paris in search of leisure, and found that a new
claim on his time was established. The king and the bishops
wanted to employ his pen in their literary warfare against Rome.
They compelled him to write first one, then a second, pamphlet
on the subject of the day,&mdash;the royal supremacy. At last,
ashamed of thus misappropriating Casaubon&rsquo;s stores of learning,
they set him upon a refutation of the <i>Annals</i> of Baronius, then
in the full tide of its credit and success. Upon this task Casaubon
spent his remaining strength and life. He died in great suffering
on the 1st of July 1614. His complaint was an organic and
congenital malformation of the bladder; but his end was
hastened by an unhealthy life of over-study, and latterly by his
anxiety to acquit himself creditably in his criticism on Baronius.
He was buried in Westminster Abbey. The monument by which
his name is there commemorated was erected in 1632 by his friend
Thomas Morton when bishop of Durham.</p>

<p>Besides the editions of ancient authors which have been
mentioned, Casaubon published with commentaries Persius,
Suetonius, the <i>Scriptores Historiae Augustae</i>. The edition of
Polybius, on which he had spent vast labour, he left unfinished.
His most ambitious work was his revision of the text of
the <i>Deipnosophistae</i> of Athenaeus, with commentary. The Theophrastus
perhaps exhibits his most characteristic excellences
as a commentator. The <i>Exercitationes in Baronium</i> are but a
fragment of the massive criticism which he contemplated;
it failed in bringing before the reader the uncritical character of
Baronius&rsquo;s history, and had only a moderate success, even
among the Protestants. His correspondence (in Latin) was
finally collected by Van Almeloveen (Rotterdam, 1709), who
prefixed to the letters a careful life of Isaac Casaubon. But this
learned Dutch editor was acquainted with Casaubon&rsquo;s diary
only in extract. This diary, <i>Ephemerides</i>, of which the MS.
is preserved in the chapter library of Canterbury, was printed in
1850 by the Clarendon Press. It forms the most valuable
record we possess of the daily life of a scholar, or man of letters,
of the 16th century.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASCADE MOUNTAINS,<a name="ar122" id="ar122"></a></span> a continuation northward of the
Sierra Nevada, some 500 m. across the states of Oregon and
Washington, U.S.A., into British Columbia. In American
territory the range lies from 100 to 150 m. from the coast. The
Cascades are separated on the S. from the Sierras by deep
valleys near Mt. Shasta in California, while on the N., somewhat
below the international boundary of 49° N., they approach the
northern Rockies, mingling with these in inextricable confusion,
although their name is given also to the much-broken, river-dissected,
central mountain plateau that crosses British Columbia
from S.E. to N.W. Geologically the Sierras and Cascades are
very different, though their exact relations are not yet clearly
determined; topographically they are also different. The
Cascades are in general a comparatively low, broad mass surmounted
by a number of imposing peaks in Oregon and
Washington. Especially north of the Columbia river, the
range widens out into a plateau. There are no notable elevations
in British Columbia. Evidences of volcanic activity in comparatively
recent geologic time are abundant throughout the
length of the range, and all the highest summits are volcanic
cones, covered with snow fields and, in a number of instances,
with glaciers. The grandest peaks are Shasta (14,380 ft.) at
the southern end, and Rainier (or Tacoma, 14,363 ft.) in
Washington, two of the most magnificent mountains of America.
Other notable summits are Mt. Pitt (9760), Mt. Scott (9122),
Diamond Peak (8807), Mt. Thielsen (9250), Mt. Jefferson
(10,200) and Mt. Hood (11,225), in Oregon; and Stuart (9470),
St Helens (10,000), Baker (10,827) and Adams (12,470), in
Washington. The Fraser river in the far north, the Columbia
at the middle, and the Klamath in the south cut athwart the
range to the Pacific, and many minor streams descend the range
to swell their waters, while some drain directly from the flanks
of the mountains into Puget Sound and Gray&rsquo;s Harbor. The
Columbia has cut almost to the sea-level through the great
mountain mass, the Dalles being only about 100 ft. above the
sea. It is to the Cascades of the tremendous rapids at this point
that the mountains owe their name. The slopes of the Cascades,
particularly on the west, which has a very much moister climate
than the eastern slope, are clothed with magnificent forests,
chiefly of coniferous evergreens: firs, pine, tamarack and cedar.
The Douglas fir, the &ldquo;Oregon pine&rdquo; of commerce, often attaining
a height of 250 ft., is one of the most beautiful trees in the world.
There are also a variety of deciduous trees, but in the aggregate
they are unimportant. In 1910 the mountain forests were
largely included in ten national forest reserves, with a total
area of nearly 16,000,000 acres, extending from the northern
boundary of Washington to the southern boundary of Oregon.
The magnificent forest cloak, splendid peaks, great open
mountain plateau pastures, and exquisite lakes embosomed in
mountain fastnesses and forest gloom, give variety to the
scenery, which is often grand, and throughout the range indescribably
beautiful, though perhaps not equal to the Sierra
Nevada in splended light and colour. Large game&mdash;deer, bears,
mountain sheep and goats, wolves and panthers&mdash;still abound.
Two great railway systems, the Great Northern and the Northern
Pacific, cross the Cascades through noteworthy tunnels; that
on the former line is 2½ m. long, that on the latter a little less
than 2 m.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASE, JOHN<a name="ar123" id="ar123"></a></span> (d. 1600), English Aristotelian scholar and
physician, was born at Woodstock. He was educated at Oxford,
and elected to a fellowship at St John&rsquo;s College, which he was
obliged to resign in consequence of his Roman Catholic sympathies.
He subsequently opened a philosophical school in
Oxford, which was largely attended. He enjoyed a great reputation
as a logician and dialectician, and was in addition an
authority on music and a distinguished physician. He is described
as &ldquo;a man of an innocent, meek, religious and studious
life,&rdquo; an agreeable conversationalist, an enthusiastic teacher,
and a great favourite with his pupils. Most of his works were
commentaries on various treatises of Aristotle (<i>Organon, Ethics,
Politics, Oeconomics, Physics</i>) under curious titles; they enjoyed
a large circulation during his time, and were frequently reprinted.
He was also the author of <i>The Praise of Musicke</i> (1586), dedicated
to Sir Walter Raleigh.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASE<a name="ar124" id="ar124"></a></span>. (1) (From Lat. <i>casus</i>, that which falls or happens;
<i>cadere</i>, to fall), a word used in various senses traceable to the
derivation. In grammar, the &ldquo;cases&rdquo; are the various forms
in the declension of a noun, adjective or pronoun, the Latin
word being a translation of the Greek <span class="grk" title="ptosis">&#960;&#964;&#8182;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>, falling, applied
by Aristotle to the variations from the simple form of the word,
whether noun, verb or adjective (of which the adverb would be
a <span class="grk" title="ptosis">&#960;&#964;&#8182;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>). Later grammarians confined the term to nouns,
and included the nominative. In law, &ldquo;case&rdquo; is the common
term for a cause or suit brought before a court of justice. Certain
particular legal usages may also be noted. <i>Action on the case</i>
means an action for the recovery of damages for an injury to the
person or property, where the act done was not immediately
injurious (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Contract</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Tort</a></span>). A <i>case stated</i> is a statement
of facts drawn up by one court for the opinion of another on a
point of law. A <i>special case</i> is a statement of facts agreed to on
behalf of two or more litigant parties, and submitted for the
opinion of a court of justice as to the law bearing upon the facts
so stated. A <i>leading case</i> is a decision which settles some point
of importance. In the legal systems of the United Kingdom
and of the United States decided cases are considered authoritative
for courts of at least equal jurisdiction with those in which the
judgments were given, but on the continent of Europe the rule
is, following that of the Roman law, that they are instructive
but not authoritative.</p>

<p>(2) (O. Fr. <i>casse</i>, mod. <i>châsse</i>, Lat. <i>capsa</i>, from <i>capere</i>, to hold;
cf. &ldquo;cash&rdquo;), a box, sheath or covering. The term is applied to
the natural protective covering of seed-vessels, and of a pupa
or chrysalis. It is also used of a box containing instruments,
pistols, swords, &amp;c., and sometimes of the contents. In building,
a &ldquo;case&rdquo; is the facing where the backing may be of inferior
material; the framework in which a window or door is hung;
or the wall surrounding a stair, &ldquo;staircase&rdquo; properly signifying
the whole structure of walls and stairs. In bookbinding, a
&ldquo;case&rdquo; means the boards and back in which the books are bound;
and in typography, the tray, divided into partitions, containing
the type ready for the compositor&rsquo;s use.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASEMATE<a name="ar125" id="ar125"></a></span> (Ital. <i>casa</i>, a house, and <i>matta</i>, dull or dim),

employed in cornices.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASEMENT<a name="ar126" id="ar126"></a></span> (from a Lat. form <i>casamentum</i>), in architecture,

<p><span class="bold">CASERTA,<a name="ar127" id="ar127"></a></span> a town and episcopal see of Campania, Italy,
the capital of the province of Caserta, situated 21 m. N. by E.
of Naples by rail via Accerra, and 23 m. via Aversa. Pop.
(1901) town, 19,180; commune, 33,373. The modern town
(229 ft.) was a mere village belonging to the Caetani family of
Sermoneta, who were counts of Caserta, until its purchase from
them by Charles IV. of Naples, and the erection of the royal
palace, begun by Luigi Vanvitelli (van Wittel) in 1752, but not
completed until 1774 for Charles&rsquo;s son Ferdinand IV. It forms
a rectangle, the south front being 830 ft. long and 134 ft. high,
with 37 windows in each storey. The interior is richly decorated
with marbles, almost all of which, except the white Carrara
marble, are Neapolitan or Sicilian. The staircase, the chapel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page445" id="page445"></a>445</span>
and the theatre are especially sumptuous. The extensive
gardens which occupy the hillside behind the palace are adorned
with fountains and cascades; the botanical garden contains
many trees from northern climates. Two miles north is S. Leucio,
a village founded by Ferdinand IV. in 1789, with a royal casino,
and large silk factories which are still active. The old town
(Caserta Vecchia) lies high (1310 ft.) about 3 m. to the north-east.
It was founded in the 9th century by the Lombards of Capua.
The cathedral has not suffered from restoration. It was completed
in 1153. It is a copy of that of Sessa Aurunca, and preserves
the type of the Latin basilica. The campanile, Sicilian in style,
was completed in 1234, while the dome, which betrays similar
motives, is even later. Its pulpit is decorated with the richest
polychrome mosaic that can be found anywhere in Sicily or
south Italy, and is quite Moslem in its brilliance. It is indeed remarkable
to find these motives in a church so far inland (Bertaux,
<i>L&rsquo;Art dans l&rsquo;Italie méridionale</i>, Paris, 1904, i. 353, &amp;c.). There
are also the ruins of the old walls.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASE-SHOT,<a name="ar128" id="ar128"></a></span> a projectile used in ordnance for fighting at
close quarters. It consists of a thin metal case containing a
large number of bullets or other small projectiles (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ammunition</a></span>). Case-shot was formerly called &ldquo;canister,&rdquo;
though the term now used occurs as early as 1625.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASH,<a name="ar129" id="ar129"></a></span> (1) (From O. Fr. <i>casse</i>, mod. <i>caisse</i>, a box or chest;
cf. &ldquo;case&rdquo;), a term which, originally meaning a box in which
money is kept, is now commonly applied to ready money or coin.
In commercial and banking usage &ldquo;cash&rdquo; is sometimes confined
to specie; it is also, in opposition to bills, drafts or securities,
applied to bank-notes. Hence &ldquo;to cash&rdquo; means to convert
cheques and other negotiable instruments into coin. In bookkeeping,
in such expressions as &ldquo;petty cash,&rdquo; &ldquo;cash-book,&rdquo;
and the like, it has the same significance, and so also in
&ldquo;cash-payment&rdquo; or ready-money payment as opposed to
&ldquo;credit,&rdquo; however the payment may be made, by coin, notes
or cheque.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;cash on delivery&rdquo; or &ldquo;collect on delivery&rdquo; system,
known as C.O.D., is one whereby a tradesman can, through a
delivery agency, send goods to a customer, and have the money
due to him collected on the delivery of the same, with a guarantee
from the carrier that, if no money be collected, the goods shall
be returned. The function of such an agency is performed in
the United States of America by the express companies (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Express</a></span>). In most countries of the continent of Europe the
post office acts as such an agent, as in Germany (where the
system is known as <i>Post-Nachnahme</i>) and in France (<i>contre
remboursement</i>). It is also in use in India, where it is known as
&ldquo;value payable,&rdquo; and was introduced in 1877 in Australia.
The advantages of the system are obvious, from the point of view
both of the customer, who can, by post or telegram, order and
obtain speedy delivery from large towns, and of the tradesman,
whose area of trade is indefinitely extended. The system does
away with credit or the delay and inconvenience of paying in
advance. The success of the large &ldquo;catalogue&rdquo; houses in
America has been mainly due to the system as operated by the
express companies. At various times, notably in 1904, it has
been proposed that the General Post Office of the United
Kingdom should adopt the system. The consistent opposition
of the retail traders in large urban centres other than the large
stores, and of the country shopkeeper generally, has been
sufficient to secure the refusal of the postmaster-general to
the proposed scheme, but a commencement was made in 1908
for orders not exceeding £20 between the United Kingdom and
Egypt, Cyprus and Malta, and certain British post offices in
Turkey and Tangier.</p>

<p>(2) (From Tamil <i>kas&#363;</i>, Sinhalese <i>kasi</i>, a small coin, adopted
by Portuguese as <i>caixa</i>, a box, and similarly assimilated in
English to &ldquo;cash&rdquo; above), a name given by English residents
in the East to native coins of small value, and particularly to
the copper coinage of China, the native name for which is <i>tsien</i>.
This, the only coin minted by the government, should bear a
fixed ratio of 1000 cash to one <i>tael</i> of silver, but in practice
there is no such fixed value. It is the universal medium of
exchange throughout China for all retail transactions. The <i>tsien</i>
is a round disk of copper alloy, with a square hole punched
through the centre for stringing. A &ldquo;string of cash&rdquo; amounts
to 500 or 1000 cash, strung in divisions of 50 or 100.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASHEL,<a name="ar130" id="ar130"></a></span> a city of Co. Tipperary, Ireland, in the east parliamentary
division, 5 m. S.E. of Goold&rsquo;s Cross and Cashel station
on the main line of the Great Southern &amp; Western railway,
96 m. S.W. from Dublin. Pop. of urban district (1901) 2938.
The town, which lies at the base of the Rock of Cashel, is of
somewhat poor appearance, but contains several public buildings.
There are also the cathedral church of St John the Baptist
(c. 1780), the deanery house (once the bishop&rsquo;s palace), and a
Roman Catholic church. Cashel gives name to a Roman Catholic
archdiocese.</p>

<p>The Rock of Cashel is the object of chief interest in the place.
This elevation of limestone formation rises abruptly from the
plain to a height of about 300 ft. and is a commanding object
for many miles around. Its summit is occupied by one of the
most interesting assemblages of ruins in Ireland, consisting of the
remains of St Patrick&rsquo;s cathedral, a round tower, Cormac&rsquo;s
chapel, and an ancient cross. The chapel, which is said to have
been erected by King Cormac M&lsquo;Carthy in the 12th century,
combines the ancient form of high stone roof, having chambers
between the pitch and the vault, with the richest Norman
decoration; the chancel arch being of especial magnificence.
The cathedral, of the 13th century, is cruciform in design,
with lancet windows and pointed arches, and contains many
interesting sculptures and tombs. In the adjoining cemetery
there stands, on a rude pedestal, whereon the kings of Munster
were crowned, the &ldquo;Cross of Cashel,&rdquo; with an effigy of St Patrick
and a portrayal of the Crucifixion sculptured on its sides. The
round tower, situated at the north-east angle of the cathedral,
is 80 ft. high with a circumference of 50 ft., and unlike the
neighbouring ruins is built, not of the limestone of the &ldquo;Rock,&rdquo;
but of freestone. Of the defences of the Rock a massive guard-tower
and portions of the wall remain. At the base of the Rock
is Hore Abbey, a Cistercian foundation (1272), exhibiting a
similar style of architecture to that of the cathedral on the Rock;
and within the town is a Dominican priory (1243), of which the
east window is a beautiful example of the style of the period.
From the Rock itself an extensive prospect is commanded over
the rich Golden Vale backed by the Galtee Mountains, the Devil&rsquo;s
Bit, and other ranges; the clustering roofs of the city providing
a picturesque foreground.</p>

<p>The history of Cashel belongs to the early period of Irish
chronology. Legend states that the vision of an angel blessing
the Rock, seen by two swineherds early in the 5th century, led
Core Mac Luighdheach, king of Munster, to establish a stronghold
here. It became one of the principal seats of the kings
of Munster, but in 1101 it was given over to the church by
King Murkertagh O&rsquo;Brien. It afterwards became noteworthy
as the place where Henry II. received the homage of
O&rsquo;Brien, king of Limerick, and still later, where Edward Bruce
held his Irish parliament. The cathedral was burnt in 1495
by the earl of Kildare. Cashel was taken by storm during
the wars of 1647. It was reduced from an archbishopric to a
bishopric in 1839, and was disfranchised, on account of corrupt
practice, in 1870, having previously returned one member to
parliament.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASHEW NUT,<a name="ar131" id="ar131"></a></span> the fruit of the cashew, cadju or acajou
tree, <i>Anacardium occidentale</i> (nat. ord. Anacardiaceae), a native
of the West Indian Islands. The fruit is kidney-shaped, about
an inch in length, and the kernel is enclosed in two coverings,
the outer of which is smooth, grey and leathery. Inside this
external rind is a dark-coloured layer, containing an excessively
acrid juice. The kernels have a bland, oily, pleasant taste.
They are much eaten, both raw and roasted, in the tropical
regions in which the tree is cultivated, and they yield a light-coloured,
sweet-tasted oil, said to be equal to olive oil for culinary
purposes. The fruit-stalk, immediately under the fruit, is
swollen and fleshy, and assumes a pear-like shape. This swollen
portion of the stalk has a pleasant acid taste, and is eaten under

used in the same sense in most European languages. It is now
used in English for the dismissal of a commissioned officer from

of the Army Act, 1881, s. 16, for &ldquo;behaving in a scandalous

<p><span class="bold">CASH REGISTER,<a name="ar134" id="ar134"></a></span> a species of calculating machine adapted
for use in connexion with the cash-tills of shops, in order to
provide a record of the money received. Such machines are made
in great variety and widely used. Sometimes the records are
constituted by holes punched in a roll of paper; in other cases
they are shown on dials by the aid of adding mechanism. A
common form has a number of keys, each representing a particular
sum and each attached to a counting mechanism which records
how many times it has been used. By pressing appropriate
combinations of these keys the amount of any purchase can be
registered, and the combined records of all the counting mechanism
give the total that has been passed through the machine in any
selected period. Each key when pressed also raises an indicator
which informs the customer how much he has to pay. In their
more elaborate forms these cash registers may have a separate
money-drawer for each assistant employed in the shop, thus
enabling the proprietor to ascertain how many customers each
man has served and how much money he has taken, and also to
fix responsibility for mistakes, bad money, &amp;c. The machines
are also made to deliver a printed receipt for each purchase,
showing the amount, date and assistant concerned, and they
may be arranged to keep separate records of credit sales, money
received on account, and money paid out.</p>

of junction of the Via Appia and Via Latina, and at their crossing
of the river Volturnus by a three-arched bridge, which still
exists, gave it considerable importance under the Roman
republic; and while the original pre-Roman town, which was
doubtless dependent on the neighbouring Capua, stood entirely
on the left (S.) bank, surrounded on three sides by the river,
the Roman city extended to the right bank also; remains of
it have been found at some 25 ft. below the modern ground-level,
the river-bed having risen considerably. In the Second Punic War
it was occupied by Fabius Cunctator in 217 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, taken by Hannibal
after a gallant defence by troops from Praeneste and Perusia
in the winter of 216-215, but recaptured in the following year,
serving the Romans as their base of operations against Capua.
It lost its independence and became a <i>praefectura</i>. Caesar
conducted a colony thither in 59 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, which was renewed by
Antony in 44 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> The veterans took Octavian&rsquo;s side after
Caesar&rsquo;s death, but it seems to have been united with Capua
before the time of Vespasian, and it does not occur in the list of
independent communities given by Pliny, who indeed (<i>Hist.
Nat.</i> iii. 70) speaks of the <i>morientis Casilini reliquiae</i>, and only
its position at the junction of the roads redeemed it from utter
insignificance.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASIMIR III<a name="ar136" id="ar136"></a></span>., called &ldquo;<span class="sc">The Great</span>,&rdquo; king of Poland (1310-1370),
the son of Wladislaus Lokietek, king of Poland, and
Jadwiga, princess of Kalisch, was born at Kowal in Kujavia
in 1310. Casimir belongs to that remarkable group of late
medieval sovereigns who may be called the fathers of modern
diplomacy, inasmuch as they relegated warfare to its proper
place as the instrument of politics, and preferred the council-chamber
to the battle-field. He was educated at the court of
Charles Robert of Hungary, who had married Casimir&rsquo;s beautiful
sister Elizabeth, and who gave his brother-in-law an excellent
education under Italian masters. In his youth Casimir was
considered frivolous and licentious; while his sudden flight
from the field of Plowce, the scene of his father&rsquo;s great victory
over the Teutonic knights, argued but poorly for his personal
courage. When, therefore, he ascended the Polish throne in 1333,
the future of his country, which then consisted of little more than
the lately reunited provinces of Great and Little Poland, seemed
dark indeed; especially as she was still at war with the Teutonic
Order and with John of Luxemburg, king of Bohemia, who
claimed the crown of Poland also. Fortunately Casimir was a
man of penetrating genius. His father had been a hero who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page447" id="page447"></a>447</span>
trusted entirely to his sword, yet the heroic struggle of a lifetime
had barely sufficed to keep at bay the numerous and potent foes
with which Poland was environed. Casimir recognized from the
first that further fighting against tremendous odds was unprofitable.
A careful, calculating dynastic policy, which aimed at the
establishment of an equilibrium by means of prudent compromises
and defensive alliances, was, he rightly judged, the best
guarantee for the future safety and glory of Poland. Casimir began
by tying the hands of the Teutonic Order by the truce of Thorn;
he induced the king of Bohemia to relinquish his claims to the
Polish throne by consenting to leave him a free hand in Silesia
(conference of Trencsén, early in 1335); and subsequently he
attended the celebrated congress of Visegrád (November 12-December
3, 1335), where Charles Robert entertained him
and the king of Bohemia magnificently. At this congress the
differences between Casimir and John of Bohemia were finally
adjusted; peace was made between the king of Poland and the
Teutonic Order on the basis of the cession of Pomerania, Kulm,
and Michalow to the knights, who retroceded Kujavia and
Dobrzyn; and the kings of Hungary and Poland further agreed
to assist each other in the acquisition of the south-eastern
border province of Halicz, or Red Russia (very nearly corresponding
to the modern Galicia), in case the necessity for intervention
should arise. The Holy See, jealous of the growing power of
the house of Luxemburg, attempted to set aside the decrees
of the congress of Visegrád, by urging Casimir to take up arms
against the knights once more; but Casimir prudently refrained
from hostilities, and ultimately compensated himself in the south-east
for his losses in the north. To guarantee still further the
integrity of Poland, Casimir, who had no male issue, concluded
a compact with Charles Robert whereby he recognized Louis,
Charles Robert&rsquo;s son, as the successor to the Polish crown;
Louis on his part contracting to confirm the privileges of the
Polish gentry and clergy, and to rule Poland through natives only.</p>

<p>In 1340 the death of George II. of Halicz, and the ravaging
of that fruitful border principality by the Tatars, induced Casimir
and Charles Robert to establish their joint influence there, and
in 1344 the Red Russian boyar, Demetrius Detko, was appointed
<i>starosta</i>, or governor, in the names of the two kings. Nine years
later Lubart of Lithuania, who also had claims upon Red Russia,
disputed the sway of Poland in that principality. Hungary
coming to the assistance of Poland, Lubart was defeated and
taken prisoner; but Casimir, anxious to avoid a bloody war
with Lithuania&rsquo;s Tatar allies, came to a compromise with Lubart
whereby Poland retained Halicz with Lemberg, while Vladimir,
Belz, and Brzesc fell to the share of Lithuania. With the Teutonic
knights, still Poland&rsquo;s most dangerous foe, Casimir preserved
peaceful relations throughout his reign. He kept them within
due bounds by using the influence of the Luxemburgers against
them at the papal court; but the disputes between Poland and
the order were ultimately settled by the peace of Kalisz (July
23, 1343), when the knights engaged for the first time to pay
tribute to the Polish crown. John of Bohemia was also a constant
thorn in the side of Casimir. Silesia, now split up into
seventeen principalities, was the bone of contention between them;
and when Casimir suddenly invaded that country, took Wschowa,
and made Prince Charles of Bohemia a prisoner, war between
the two kingdoms actually broke out and Casimir was besieged in
Cracow by the Czechs. But his Hungarian allies hastened to
his assistance, and the mediation of the Holy See restored
peace in 1346. The death of the adventurous John at Crécy,
and the election of his son as emperor, still further improved the
situation. Charles IV., a cautious sovereign with many cares,
was as anxious for the maintenance of peace as Casimir himself.
Thus the relations between them were never very seriously
disturbed.</p>

<p>Throughout his reign Casimir never neglected the great work
of domestic reform, greatly aided by Jaroslaw Skotowicki,
archbishop of Gnesen, formerly a professor at Bologna. The
first result of their joint labours was the much-needed codification
of the laws of Great and Little Poland in 1347. This was followed
by the establishment of a supreme court of appeal in 1357.
Towards everything like disorder, tyranny, or aristocratic
oppression, Casimir was always inexorably severe; all disturbers
of the peace were remorselessly put to death as the worst
enemies of their country and he enjoyed in consequence the
honourable title of &ldquo;the Peasants&rsquo; King.&rdquo; The lawlessness
of the nobility was most noticeable in the province of Great
Poland, where outrageous acts of violence were of everyday
occurrence. To remedy the evil, Casimir drew up and promulgated
the severe statute of Great Poland, which went to the
very root of the matter and greatly strengthened the hands of
the king&rsquo;s justices. Casimir also did much for education.
Stimulated by the example of Charles IV., who had founded the
university of Prague in 1348, Casimir on the 12th of May 1364
established and richly endowed the first university of Cracow,
which had five professors of Roman law, three of Canon law,
two of physics, and one master of arts. The security of the
kingdom was sensibly promoted by the erection of a cordon of
fortresses on its north-eastern borders, and a blow was given to
foreign interference when Casimir succeeded in gaining dominant
influence over the independent Polish principality of Masovia,
which had hitherto gravitated between Bohemia and the
Teutonic Order.</p>

<p>Casimir&rsquo;s last political act was the conclusion of a fresh
alliance with Louis of Hungary against Charles IV. at Buda
in 1369. He died on the 5th of November 1370 from the effects
of an injury received while hunting. Though married three
times Casimir left no sons; but he had the satisfaction of knowing
that his domains would pass into the hands of a nephew every
whit as capable and sagacious as himself.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASIMIR IV<a name="ar137" id="ar137"></a></span>., king of Poland (1427-1492), second son of
Wladislaus II. Jagiello, was appointed while still a lad grand-duke
of Lithuania by his father, and crowned king of Poland
at Cracow in June 1447, three years after the death of his elder
brother, Wladislaus III., at the battle of Varna. The cause of
this long interregnum was the disinclination of the Lithuanians
to part with their prince till their outstanding differences with
Poland, relating chiefly to the delimitation of the frontiers of the
two states, had been settled. Casimir&rsquo;s reign of forty-five years
was epoch-making for Poland. He was without doubt one of the
greatest statesmen of his age, concealing beneath a simple
exterior and homely habits a profound political sagacity and an
unerring common-sense, and possessing in a high degree those
useful qualities of patience, moderation, and tenacity, which
characterized nearly all the princes of the house of Jagiello.
Throughout life he steadily followed two guiding principles&mdash;the
preservation of the political union between Poland and
Lithuania at whatever cost, and the recovery of the lost lands
of old Poland. It was due entirely to his steadfast adherence to
these principles that Poland in the course of the 15th century
rose to the rank of a great power; but by a singular irony of
fate, Casimir, in consequence of his unswerving efforts to make
his country glorious and prosperous, entirely forfeited the
popularity of his Polish subjects, whose true interests he understood
far better than they did themselves. Thus his refusal to
sacrifice Polish to Lithuanian or Lithuanian to Polish interests
caused both Poles and Lithuanians to accuse the far-seeing monarch
of partiality and favouritism; while his anti-German policy,
on which the future safety of the dual state depended, could
only be carried through by the most humiliating concessions
to patrician pride and greed. His difficulties were moreover
considerably enhanced by the fact that he was not of an essentially
martial temperament, and could not therefore appeal to the
heroic side of the Polish character.</p>

<p>The great triumph of Casimir&rsquo;s reign was the final subjugation
of the Teutonic Order, a triumph only accomplished after a
harassing and desultory thirteen years&rsquo; war, during which
Casimir&rsquo;s own subjects gave him more trouble than all his
enemies. The pretext of the rupture was the attempt of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page448" id="page448"></a>448</span>
knights to crush the Prussian diet, which, bearing as it did most
of the burdens, claimed fairly enough a proportionate share
in the government of the Prussian provinces. Excommunicated
by the pope and placed under the ban of the Empire, the
Prussian cities and gentry naturally turned to their nearest
neighbour, Poland, for protection. In October 1453 they placed
themselves beneath the overlordship of Casimir; on the 4th of
February 1454 formally renounced their ancient allegiance to the
Order; and some weeks later captured no fewer than fifty-seven
towns and castles. On the 6th of March 1454 Casimir issued
a manifesto directing the incorporation of the Prussian provinces
with Poland, but granting them at the same time freedom
from taxation and full autonomy. But except in the border
province of Great Poland, the acquisition of this new territory
excited little interest and no enthusiasm in Poland generally.
The local diets granted subsidies with a niggard hand, and for
the conduct of the war the king soon had to depend almost
entirely on Hussite mercenaries, who frequently turned against
him when their wages were not paid. The Polish gentry on the
other hand exhibited far less energy in the field than in the
council chamber; they were defeated again and again by the
knights, and showed themselves utterly incapable of taking
fortresses. No wonder then if in the earlier years of the war
the Order recovered its lost ground, and the king, irritated
beyond endurance by the suicidal parsimony of the estates,
threatened to retire to the forests of Lithuania. But manlier
counsels prevailed, the struggle was resumed, and after the
bloody victory of Puck (September 17, 1462) the scales of
fortune inclined decisively to the side of Poland. Finally
the Holy See intervened, and by the second peace of Thorn
(October 14, 1466) all West Prussia, as it is now called,
was ceded to Poland, while East Prussia was left in the hands of
the knights, who held it as a fief of the Polish crown.</p>

<p>The intervention of the Curia, which hitherto had been hostile
to Casimir because of his steady and patriotic resistance to papal
aggression, was due to the permutations of European politics.
The pope was anxious to get rid of the Hussite king of Bohemia,
George Pod&#283;brad, as the first step towards the formation of a
league against the Turk. Casimir was to be a leading factor in this
combination, and he took advantage of it to procure the election
of his son Wladislaus as king of Bohemia. But he would not
commit himself too far, and his ulterior plans were frustrated
by the rivalry of Matthias Corvinus, king of Hungary, who even
went so far as to stimulate the Teutonic Order to rise against
Casimir. The death of Matthias in 1490 was a great relief to
Poland, and Casimir employed the two remaining years of his
reign in consolidating his position still further. He expired rather
suddenly while hunting at Troki in Lithuania in June 1492.</p>

<p>The feature of Casimir&rsquo;s character which most impressed his
contemporaries was his extraordinary simplicity and sobriety.
He, one of the greatest monarchs in Europe, habitually wore
plain Cracow cloth, drank nothing but water, and kept the
most austere of tables. His one passion was the chase. Yet
his liberality to his ministers and servants was proverbial, and
his vanquished enemies he always treated with magnificent
generosity. Casimir&rsquo;s married life was singularly happy. His
consort, Elizabeth of Austria, &ldquo;the mother of the Jagiellos,&rdquo;
bore him six sons and seven daughters, and by her affection and
good counsel materially relieved the constant anxieties and
grievous burdens of his long and arduous reign.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASIMIR-PÉRIER, JEAN PAUL PIERRE<a name="ar138" id="ar138"></a></span> (1847-1907), fifth
president of the French Republic, was born in Paris on the 8th
of November 1847, being the grandson of Casimir Pierre Périer
(<i>q.v.</i>) the famous premier of Louis Philippe. He entered public
life as secretary to his father, A.V.L.C. Périer, who was minister
of the interior under the presidency of Thiers. In 1874 he was
elected general councillor of the Aube, and was sent by the same
department to the chamber of deputies in the general elections
of 1876, and he was always re-elected until his presidency. In
spite of the traditions of his family, Casimir-Périer joined the
group of Republicans on the Left, and was one of the 363 on the
<i>Seize-Mai</i> (1877). If he refused to vote the expulsion of the
princes in 1883, and resigned as deputy upon the enactment of
the law, it was only owing to personal connexions with the family
of Orleans. On the 17th of August 1883 he became under-secretary
of state for war, and retained that position until the 7th
of January 1885. From 1890 to 1892 he was vice-president of
the chamber, then in 1893 president. On the 3rd of December
he became prime-minister, holding the department of foreign
affairs, resigned in May 1894, and was re-elected president of the
chamber. On the 24th of June 1894, after the assassination of
President Carnot, he was elected president of the republic by
451 votes against 195 for Henri Brisson and 97 for Charles Dupuy.
His presidency lasted only six months. The resignation of the
Dupuy ministry on the 14th of January 1895 was followed the
next day by that of the president. Casimir-Périer explained his
action by the fact that he found himself ignored by the ministers,
who did not consult him before taking decisions, and did not keep
him informed upon political events, especially in foreign affairs.
From that time he definitely and absolutely abandoned politics,
and devoted himself to business&mdash;especially mining. At the
trial of Dreyfus at Rennes, Casimir-Périer&rsquo;s evidence, as opposed
to that of General Mercier, was of great value to the cause of
Dreyfus. He died on the 11th of March 1907.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASINO<a name="ar139" id="ar139"></a></span> (diminutive of <i>casa</i>, a house), the Italian name for a
pleasure-house in a garden, which has been extended to a place
of public amusement at pleasure resorts, in which concerts,
theatrical performances and public balls are given, and which
usually contains a <i>café-restaurant</i> and gaming saloons. &ldquo;Casino&rdquo;
as an architectural term is still employed in France, and the
subject is given in competitive programmes in the French schools
of design. In the 18th century in England many Italian examples
were built in the parks of country mansions, and Sir William
Chambers in his treatise on civil architecture publishes plates of
the casinos he had built at Marino, near Dublin, Wilton near
Salisbury, and Birdshall, Yorkshire.</p>

<p><i>Casino</i> or <i>Cassino</i> is also the name given to a game of cards of
obscure origin, played with a full whist-pack. The object is to
take as many cards as possible, particularly such as have special
value. It may be played by two, three or four persons, partners
sitting opposite one another. The player at the dealer&rsquo;s right is
called the pony (<i>pone</i>), the one at his left the eldest hand. The
dealer (selected by the cut of the lowest card) deals four cards to
each player by twos and also, just before dealing to himself, four
to the table, face upwards. The eldest hand begins the game by
playing a card in one of three ways. Either he may take one of
the exposed cards on the table by matching it with one from his
own hand; or he may put one of his cards upon one of the table
hand and call the sum of the pips (called <i>building</i>); or thirdly,
failing to do either of these things, he must <i>trail</i>, <i>i.e.</i> lay a card
face upwards on the table beside the exposed cards, and the
player at his left then plays in his turn. When each player has
played out all four of his cards the dealer deals four more all
round, and the game proceeds until the pack is exhausted. The
game either (1) ends at this juncture, the player having secured
the most points winning; or (2) the side or player first securing
21 points wins; or (3) the points secured in a given number of
deals may determine the winner. The points and their respective
values are as follows:&mdash;<i>Big</i> (or Great) <i>Casino</i> (ten of diamonds), 2;
<i>Little Casino</i> (deuce of spades), 1; <i>Cards</i> (greatest number), 3;
<i>Spades</i> (greatest number), 1; <i>Aces</i>, 1 each or 4 together; <i>Sweeps</i>
1 each. Thus, without <i>sweeps</i>, the maximum points in one deal
are 11. A sweep is a play that clears the table of all exposed cards.
The game then proceeds by the next player placing a card on the
table face upwards.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;Building,&rdquo; referred to above, is done as follows. Should a 3
lie exposed on the table, a player may place a 4 upon it, saying,
&ldquo;I build a 7,&rdquo; and, if it is not disturbed before his next turn, he
may then take the two cards with another 7 from his hand. It
follows that no combination may be built unless the builder holds
the proper card in his hand. But a build may be increased. Thus,
in the case cited above, another player may put a 2 upon the two
cards which make 7 and say, &ldquo;I build 9,&rdquo; in which case the original
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page449" id="page449"></a>449</span>
builder loses control of the build unless he also holds a 9 in his hand
or can himself increase the build again; for instance, adding an ace
and calling 10. In the old way of playing the ace counted 1, the
deuce 2, and so on as at whist, excepting that all court cards counted
10. But in the popular variation called <i>Royal Casino</i>, now almost
universally played, the ace counts either 1 or 14, the king 13, the
queen 12 and the knave 11. In this manner the opportunities for
simple and increased building are greatly multiplied, resulting in a
much livelier game.</p>

<p>If a player has made a build he must take it in on his next play,
unless he can take some other card. He cannot have two builds on
the table at the same time, nor increase another build if he already
has one of his own. <i>Double Builds</i> cannot be increased, <i>e.g.</i> if a
player combines a 3 and 4 lying on the table and places a 7 from his
hand upon them, saying, &ldquo;I build sevens,&rdquo; this build can be taken
only with a 7, and cannot be built upon further. Of course in the
case cited the builder must still have another 7 in his hand. In
playing partners each may take in the other&rsquo;s builds, or may build
to a card that has been declared by his partner; <i>e.g.</i> if his partner
has built an 8 that has been captured by an opponent, he may build
another 8 with a card from his own hand to the 8 that he knows
to be in his partner&rsquo;s hand, even though he has no 8 himself. In
<i>trailing</i>, <i>i.e.</i> laying down a card without matching or building, one
usually plays small cards, avoiding aces and (if Big and Little
Casino have not yet been played) tens and deuces, as well as any
cards one has reason to think will be of service to the enemy. High
cards are usually played last, as they are stronger in taking combinations.
Such rules are, however, quite general, each situation
calling for special treatment. In the last round all cards remaining
on the table become the property of the player taking the last trick.
A good memory and keen powers of observation are essential in
playing this game.</p>

<p>In <i>Twenty-One-Point Casino</i> nothing is scored until the end of the
deal. A second or third deal is usually necessary before one side
scores the requisite 21. In the final deal each side keeps a mental
count of the points made, and as soon as 21 are scored the game
is claimed and the points shown. But if, when added to those already
scored in previous deals, they make more or less than 21, the claimant
loses the game. In counting out <i>cards</i> count first, followed by <i>spades,
Big Casino, Little Casino, aces</i> and <i>sweeps</i>, in that order.</p>

<p><i>Spade Casino</i> is a variation in which the usual 11 points count as
in the regular game, and, in addition, each spade counts 1, excepting
the knave of spades, which counts 2, making 24 points in all. These
are scored on a cribbage-board, each point being marked as it is
made. The game is for 61 points, or once round the board and into
the game-hole.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASINUM,<a name="ar140" id="ar140"></a></span> an ancient town of Italy, probably of Volscian
origin. Varro states that the name was Sabine, and meant <i>forum
vetus</i>, and also that the town itself was Samnite, but he is probably
wrong. When it came under Roman supremacy is not known,
but it probably received the citizenship in 188 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> It was the
most south-easterly town in <i>Latium adjectum</i>, situated on the Via
Latina about 40 m. N.W. of Capua. It appears occasionally
in the history of the Hannibalic War. Varro possessed a villa near
it, in which later on Mark Antony held his orgies. Towards the
end of the republic it was a <i>praefectura</i>, and under the empire it
appears as a colony (perhaps founded by the triumvirs), though
in two (not local) inscriptions it is called <i>municipium</i>. Strabo
speaks of it as an important town; Varro mentions the olive-oil
of its district as especially good. The older Volscian Casinum
must have stood on the hill (1715 ft.) above the Roman town
(148 ft.), where considerable remains of fortifications in Cyclopean
masonry, of finely cut blocks of limestone, still exist. The site is
now occupied by the Benedictine monastery of Monte Cassino
(<i>q.v.</i>) founded by St Benedict himself in 529. A number of Roman
inscriptions from Casinum are preserved there. The wall which
runs south-west and west starting from the west side of the
monastery, for a total length of about 300 yds., is not so clearly
traceable on the other side of the hill, though there is one fragment
under the east side of the monastery; but it seems to have
defended the summit and was perhaps the original acropolis.
The Roman town lay at the foot of the mountain, close to the
Via Latina. The amphitheatre, erected by Ummidia Quadratilla
(whose passion for actors is mentioned by Pliny, <i>Epist.</i> vii. 24,
on the occasion of her death at the age of about eighty), is still
existing: it is built of <i>opus reticulatum</i> and the five entrances are
by arches of larger blocks of stone; it is approximately circular
in plan. The external walls are 59 ft. high. The seats in the
interior have disappeared. Above it on the hillside is a theatre
of <i>opus reticulatum</i>, less well preserved. Close by is a building
converted into the Cappella del Crocefisso, originally perhaps a
tomb in the Via Latina; it is a chamber in the form of a Greek
cross, constructed of large masses of travertine, with a domed roof
of the same material. On the opposite bank of the Rapido are
the ruins called Monticelli, attributed to the villa of Varro, a part of
which was frequently drawn by the architects of the 16th century
(T. Ashby in <i>Papers of the British School at Rome</i>, ii. 19). The
medieval town of S. Germano, which resumed the name Cassino
in 1871, lies a little to the north. The cathedral was founded in
the 8th century, but the present building was constructed in the
17th century. The church of S. Maria delle Cinque Torri contains
twelve ancient marble columns; above the town is a picturesque
medieval castle.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASIRI, MIGUEL<a name="ar141" id="ar141"></a></span> (1710-1791), a learned Maronite, was born
at Tripoli (Syria) in 1710. He studied at Rome, where he lectured
on Arabic, Syriac, Chaldee, philosophy and theology. In 1748
he went to Spain, and was employed in the royal library at
Madrid. He was successively appointed a member of the Royal
Academy of History, interpreter of oriental languages to the
king, and joint-librarian at the Escorial. In 1763 he became
principal librarian, a post which he appears to have held till his
death in 1791. Casiri published a work entitled <i>Bibliotheca
Arabico-Hispana Escurialensis</i> (2 vols., Madrid, 1760-1770).
It is a catalogue of above 1800 Arabic MSS., which he found in
the library of the Escorial; it also contains a number of quotations
from Arabic works on history. The MSS. are classified
according to subjects; the second volume gives an account of
a large collection of geographical and historical MSS., which
contain valuable information regarding the wars between the
Moors and the Christians in Spain. Casiri&rsquo;s work is not yet
obsolete, but a more scientific system is adopted in Hartwig
Derenbourg&rsquo;s incomplete treatise, <i>Les Manuscrits arabes de

<p><span class="bold">CASKET,<a name="ar142" id="ar142"></a></span> a small box or coffer, commonly used for jewels,
money, papers, or other objects of value. The etymology is
doubtful. It is possibly a diminutive of &ldquo;cask,&rdquo; a barrel for
wine or other liquor. The Spanish <i>casco</i> meant also a skull,
helmet, or rind of an onion, and is probably connected with
<i>cascar</i>, to break open, Latin <i>quassare</i>, French <i>casser</i>, to break, shake.
The French <i>casque, casquet</i>, of the same origin is only used of a
helmet, and the sense of &ldquo;small chest&rdquo; is not found in languages
other than English. Skeat suggests that the word is a corruption
of French <i>cassette</i>, diminutive of <i>casse</i>, box, Latin <i>capsa</i>, from
<i>capere</i>, to hold, contain, cf. English &ldquo;case.&rdquo; History and
literature are full of references to the often disconcerting contents
of these famous receptacles. The &ldquo;Casket Letters&rdquo; (<i>q.v.</i>) are
one of the mysteries of history. Harpagnon&rsquo;s casket plays
an important part in Molière&rsquo;s <i>L&rsquo;Avare</i>; Bluebeard gives his
too-curious wife the keys of his caskets filled with precious stones;
the contents of Sainte-Croix&rsquo;s casket brought about the trial and
condemnation of the marquise de Brinvilliers, the poisoner.
This very ancient piece of furniture was no doubt derived from
the chest, which was the original wardrobe. It was often an
object of great value, covered with ivory, enamel, or stamped
leather, enriched with precious metals, or encrusted with jewels.
One which belonged to St Louis and is preserved in the Louvre is
covered with enamelled shields of arms and other decorations.
In the 16th and 17th centuries secret hiding-places were sometimes
in the thickness of the lid or in a false bottom. The word
is now little used&mdash;the natural result of the desuetude of the
object; but auctioneers occasionally announce that they will sell
a &ldquo;casket of jewels,&rdquo; and undertakers, especially in the United
States, frequently use it as a grandiose synonym for &ldquo;coffin.&rdquo;</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASKET LETTERS<a name="ar143" id="ar143"></a></span>. This is the name generally given to
eight letters, and a sequence of irregular sonnets, all described as
originally in French, and said to have been addressed by Mary,
queen of Scots, to the earl of Bothwell, between January and
April 1566-1567. The nature of these documents&mdash;authentic,
forged, or partly forged, partly genuine&mdash;has been the theme of
much discussion. If authentic throughout, they afford perfect
proof of Mary&rsquo;s complicity in the murder of her husband, Henry,
Lord Darnley. The topic is so perplexing, and possibilities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page450" id="page450"></a>450</span>
are so delicately balanced, that inquirers may change their
views, and modify or reverse their opinions, on the appearance of
each fresh document that is brought to light; or even upon a
new consideration of existing evidence. Controversy centres
round a very long and singular undated epistle called &ldquo;The
Glasgow Letter&rdquo; or &ldquo;Letter II.&rdquo; If Mary wrote all of this, or
even wrote some compromising parts of it, she was certainly
guilty. But two questions remain to be settled&mdash;(1) did her
accusers at one time possess another version of this letter which
if it existed was beyond doubt a forgery? and (2) is not part of
Letter II. a forged interpolation, based on another document,
not by Mary?</p>

<p>The whole affair has been obscured and almost inextricably
entangled, as we shall see, by the behaviour of Mary&rsquo;s accusers.
Of these Maitland of Lethington was consenting to Darnley&rsquo;s
murder; the earl of Morton had, at least, guilty foreknowledge;
the regent Moray (Mary&rsquo;s natural brother) had &ldquo;looked through
his fingers&rdquo; at the crime, and for months remained on intimate
terms with the criminals. He also perjured himself when putting
before Elizabeth&rsquo;s commission of inquiry at Westminster (December
1568) a copy of the confession of Hepburn of Bowton
(Cotton MSS. British Museum. Caligula C.I. fol. 325). This
is attested as a &ldquo;true copy,&rdquo; but Moray, who had been present
when Bowton was examined (December 8, 1567), knew that
the copy presented at Westminster (December 1568) had been
mutilated because the excised passages were damning to Lethington
and the earl of Morton, accomplices in the crime of Darnley&rsquo;s
murder, and accomplices of Moray in his prosecution of his
sister. (See in Cambridge University Library, MS. Oo. 47,
fol. 5 et seq. Compare the MS. copy of the confession in the
British Museum, Cotton MSS. Caligula, C.I. fol. 325, printed
in Anderson&rsquo;s <i>Collections</i>, vol. ii. pp. 183-188.)</p>

<p>If Moray the righteous could act thus, much more might the
murderer Morton perjure himself in his averment that there
had been no tampering with the Casket Letters in his custody.
We cannot, in short, believe Mary&rsquo;s accusers on their oaths.
When they all went, in October-December 1568, to York and
London to accuse their queen&mdash;and before that, in their proclamations&mdash;they
contradicted themselves freely and frequently;
they put in a list of dates which made Mary&rsquo;s authorship of Letter
II. impossible; and they rang the changes on Scots translations
of the alleged French originals, and on the French itself. For
example, when Moray, after Mary was in Elizabeth&rsquo;s power
(May 16, 1568), wished Elizabeth to have the matter tried,
he in May-June 1568 sent John Wood to England with Scots
translations of the letters. Wood was to ask, &ldquo;if the French
originals are found to tally with the Scots translations, will that be
reckoned good evidence?&rdquo; It was as easy to send copies of
the French, and thus give no ground for the suspicion that the
Scots letters were altered on the basis of information acquired
between May and October 1568, and that the French versions
were made to fit the new form of the Scots copies. Another
source of confusion, now removed, was the later publication in
France of the letters in French. This French did not correspond
with French copies of some of the originals recently discovered
in Cecil&rsquo;s MSS. and elsewhere. But that is no ground of suspicion,
for the published French letters were not copies of the alleged
originals, but translations of Latin translations of them, from
the Scots (see T.F. Henderson, <i>The Casket Letters</i>, 1890). German
historians have not made matters more clear by treating the
Letters on the principle of &ldquo;the higher criticism&rdquo; of Homer and
the Bible. They find that the documents are of composite
origin, partly notes from Mary to Darnley, partly a diary of
Mary&rsquo;s, and so on; all combined and edited by some one who
played the part of the legendary editorial committee of Peisistratus
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Homer</a></span>), which compiled the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> out
of fragmentary lays! From all these causes, and others, arise
confusion and suspicion.</p>

<p>So much information unknown to older disputants such as
Goodall, the elder Tytler, Chalmers, and Malcolm Laing, and in
certain cases unknown even to Froude and Skelton, has accrued,
that the question can now best be studied in <i>The Casket Letters</i>,
by T.F. Henderson (1889; second issue, 1890, being the more
accurate); in <i>The Mystery of Mary Stuart</i>, by Andrew Lang
(4th edition, 1904), and in Henderson&rsquo;s criticism of that book,
in his <i>Mary, Queen of Scots</i> (1905) (Appendix A). The conclusion
arrived at here is that of Henderson, but it is reached
independently.</p>

<p>The history of the letters must be given in summary. Henderson,
in <i>The Casket Letters</i> (1889), was the first to publish and
use as evidence a document of which the existence was made
known in the fifth report of the royal commission on historical
manuscripts. It is a sworn statement of the earl of Morton,
written in 1568. A silver casket (originally Mary&rsquo;s property,
but then in the possession of Bothwell) was placed in his hands
on the 20th of June, and was inspected by several nobles and
gentlemen on the 21st of June 1567. Morton denies that the
contents, the letters, sonnets, and some other papers, had been
in any way tampered with. But if Moray could knowingly
submit garbled evidence, Morton&rsquo;s oath is of no value if uncorroborated.</p>

<p>Mary was, on the 21st of June 1567, a prisoner in Loch Leven
Castle. A messenger was at once sent from Edinburgh to London
with a letter from Lethington and a verbal message. By the 12th
of July, de Silva, the Spanish ambassador, reports on the
authority of the French ambassador that du Croc, French envoy
to Scotland, avers that Mary&rsquo;s Scottish enemies have autograph
letters of hers proving her guilt, and himself possesses copies.
Of these copies no more is heard, and they cannot be found.
According to de Silva, Elizabeth said that she did not believe
in the Letters, and that Lethington, who wrote to Cecil on the
21st of June, and sent a verbal message by the bearer, &ldquo;had
behaved badly in the matter,&rdquo;&mdash;whether that of the letters, or in
general. On what evidence she based that opinion, if she
really held it, is unknown. In December 1567 the Scottish
parliament was informed that the letters were <i>signed</i> by Mary
(they are unsigned), but the phrase is not used in the subsequent
act of parliament. The letters were exhibited and apparently
were read, probably read aloud. Mary&rsquo;s party in September
1568 declared that they were garbled, and that the handwriting
was not hers. In the end of July 1567 the earl of Moray, Mary&rsquo;s
brother, passing through London from France, told de Silva,
as de Silva reported to his government, that there was proof
of Mary&rsquo;s guilt in a letter of three double sheets of paper <i>signed</i>
by her.</p>

<p>According to Moray&rsquo;s version of the letter, Mary was to try
to poison Darnley in a house on the way between Glasgow
and Edinburgh where he and she were to stop. Clearly Lord
Livingstone&rsquo;s house, Callendar, where they did rest on their
journey, is intended. If this failed, Mary would put Darnley
&ldquo;in the house where the explosion was arranged for the night
upon which one of the servants was to be married.&rdquo; No such
arrangement had been made, as the confessions of the murderers,
at which Moray was present, clearly prove. It may be said that
de Silva means &ldquo;the house in which the explosion was <i>afterwards</i>
arranged.&rdquo; But the earl of Lennox, Darnley&rsquo;s father, understood
Moray to mean that as early as January 21-22, 1567, the
house of Kirk o&rsquo; Field, where Darnley was slain, had already been
mined. Moray&rsquo;s version of the letter made Mary tell Bothwell
to poison or put away his wife. No such matters occur in Letter
II.; Moray spoke, he said, on the authority of &ldquo;a man who had
read the letter.&rdquo; A similar account of this letter is given in a
document of Darnley&rsquo;s father, the earl of Lennox (Cambridge
University Library MSS. Oo. 7. 47; f. 17 b.). Can we suppose
that &ldquo;the man who had read the letter&rdquo; invented much of its
contents, and told them to Moray, who told de Silva, and told
Darnley&rsquo;s father, Lennox, then in or near London?</p>

<p>At this point comes in the evidence&mdash;unknown to Froude,
Skelton, Hosack, and Henderson in his book <i>The Casket Letters</i>&mdash;of
a number of documents, notes of information, and indictments
of Mary, written for or by the earl of Lennox. These MSS
are in the University Library of Cambridge, and were transcribed
by Father Stevenson. His transcripts were brought to light by
Father Pollen, S.J., who lent them, with his own notes on them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page451" id="page451"></a>451</span>
to Andrew Lang for use in his book, <i>The Mystery of Mary Stuart</i>
(1900-1904).</p>

<p>Not one of the Lennox documents is dated; all but one are
endorsed in an English hand of the period. It may be conjectured
that they were selected by Lennox from his papers, and lent by
him to some one who was writing against Mary. Among them
(Cambridge University MSS. Oo. 7. 47. fol. 17 b.) is a long
indictment of Mary, in which Lennox describes a wicked letter of
hers. As has been said, he closely follows Moray&rsquo;s version reported
by de Silva in July 1567. Lennox also gives several
stories of cruel words of Mary spoken to Darnley in the hearing
of her servants.</p>

<p>Now, on the 11th of June 1568, Lennox was in the company of
John Wood, a creature of Moray&rsquo;s, and Wood, as we saw, brought
copies of the Scots renderings of the Letters into England in
May-June 1568. It was argued by Andrew Lang that Wood
was likely to show these letters to Lennox; and that as Lennox
follows Moray&rsquo;s version of Mary&rsquo;s long and murderous letter,
and does <i>not</i> follow Letter II., the murderous letter (a forgery)
was then part of the <i>dossier</i> of Mary&rsquo;s accusers. Again, as
Lennox&rsquo;s indictment of Mary (Cambridge Oo. 7. 47. fol. 17 b.)
is rife in &ldquo;reports and sayings of Mary&rsquo;s servants&rdquo; about her
cruel words to Darnley, and as Lennox had not these reports
on the 11th of June 1568, for on that day he wrote to Scotland
asking his friends to discover them and send them to him, the
indictment (Oo. 7. 47) must have been composed long after the
11th of June. This must be so, for Lennox&rsquo;s letters of the 11th
of June were intercepted by his foes, the Hamiltons, and were
found in the Hamilton Muniment Room. Thus answers to
his inquiries were delayed. (The letters of Lennox were published
in <i>Miscellany of the Maitland Club</i>, vol. iv.)</p>

<p>Henderson, on the other side, believes that Wood &ldquo;indubitably&rdquo;
showed to Lennox the Scots copies of the Casket
Letters about the 11th of June 1568. But Lennox, he says,
could not quote Letter II. in his indictment against Mary,
and had to rest on Moray&rsquo;s version of July 1567, because Lennox&rsquo;s
indictment was completed, and even laid before Elizabeth, as
early as the 28th of May 1568. Henderson seeks to prove that
this is so by quoting from Chalmers&rsquo;s <i>Mary Queen of Scots</i> (vol.
ii. p. 289) the statement that Lennox and his wife on that day
presented to Elizabeth a &ldquo;Bill of Supplication&rdquo;; and (though he
submits that the indictment [Oo. 7. 47] is a <i>draft</i> for the Bill)
he strengthens his case by heading the indictment, which he
publishes, <i>Bill of Supplication</i>. The document, in fact, is
unendorsed, and without a title, and there is not a word of
&ldquo;supplication&rdquo; in it. It is a self-contradictory history of the
relations between Mary and Darnley.</p>

<p>Henderson&rsquo;s contention therefore seems erroneous. Lennox
could not begin to prepare an English indictment against Mary
till she was in England and in Elizabeth&rsquo;s power. He could not
hear of this fact&mdash;Mary&rsquo;s arrival in England (May 16, 1568)&mdash;before,
say, the 19th of May; and between the 19th of May and
the 28th of May he could not write for and receive from Scotland
&ldquo;the reports and sayings of her servants.&rdquo; He did not possess
them on the 11th of June, when he asked for them; he did not
get them at once, for his letters were intercepted; the indictment
(Oo. 7. 47) is rich in them; therefore that paper is not the &ldquo;Bill
of Supplication&rdquo; of the 28th of May.</p>

<p>Thus the question remains, why, if Wood about the 11th of
June showed to Lennox Letter II. in Scots, did Lennox follow
Moray&rsquo;s erroneous version of July 1567? Because in June 1568
that version, forged, was in the Scots collection of the Casket
Letters? If so, there was time for Lennox to lend to the accusers
certain notes which a retainer of his, Thomas Crawford of Jordan
Hill, swore (December 9, 1568) that he had made for Lennox
(about January 22, 1567) of secret conversations between
Darnley and Mary. Lennox (June 11, 1568) asked Crawford
for his reminiscences, <i>not</i> of Darnley&rsquo;s reports of his talks with
Mary, but of Crawford&rsquo;s own interview with her as she entered
Glasgow to visit Darnley, probably on the 21st of January 1567.
It follows that Lennox possessed Crawford&rsquo;s written notes of
the Darnley and Mary conversations. If he had not possessed
them on the 11th of June 1568, he must have asked Crawford
for his reminiscences of these talks. But he did not ask.</p>

<p>Crawford&rsquo;s evidence was all-important, because it corroborated
Mary&rsquo;s own account of her interviews with Darnley in Letter II.
That part of the letter then, it is argued by many, is a forged
interpolation based on Crawford&rsquo;s notes and memories. The
force of this contention lies in the close verbal identities between
Crawford&rsquo;s account of the Darnley-Mary interviews (see Crawford&rsquo;s
Declaration of December 9, 1568, in Lang&rsquo;s <i>Mystery
of Mary Stuart</i>, pp. 428-431; from <i>State Papers Scotland</i>,
Elizabeth vol. xiii. No. 14. Record Office) and the corresponding
passages in Letter II. (<i>Mystery of Mary Stuart</i>, pp. 396-398).
The verbal identities can only be explained in one of the following
ways. Either Letter II. is here based on Crawford; or Crawford
has copied Letter II. by way of corroborating it (a fatal step,
if the case came before a modern English court of justice); or
Darnley&rsquo;s memory of his conversation with Mary was so fresh,
when he dictated his recollection of it to Crawford on 21st-22nd
January 1567, that he reported speeches in almost the very
same words as Mary used in writing Letter II. Henderson prefers
the hypothesis that Lennox had lost Crawford&rsquo;s notes; and that
the identities are explained by the &ldquo;remarkably good memories
of Crawford and Mary, or by the more likely supposition that
Crawford, before preparing his declaration for the conference&rdquo;
(at Westminster, December 1568) &ldquo;refreshed his memory by
the letter.&rdquo; (Letter II., <i>Mary Queen of Scots</i>, p. 650.)</p>

<p>Mary did not need a particularly good memory; if she wrote,
she wrote unchecked her recollections of the day&rsquo;s talk. But
no human memory of a conversation reported on the 22nd of
January 1567, could be so nearly &ldquo;word perfect&rdquo; as Crawford&rsquo;s
must have been two years later. If Crawford &ldquo;refreshed his
memory by the letter,&rdquo; he exposed himself, and the entire case,
by copying whole passages, often with few verbal changes. If
he had access to his original notes of the 21st and 22nd of January
1567, then he was safe&mdash;that is, if Darnley&rsquo;s memory of the conversations
tallied so exactly with Mary&rsquo;s. Whether that could
be, Darnley dictating while still hot from the exciting interchange
of words which he meant to report, is a question for
psychologists. Experiments made by a person who possesses
a good memory seem to show that the thing is very possible,
especially if Darnley revised Crawford&rsquo;s notes.</p>

<p>Thus the probabilities are delicately balanced. But if any
one compares Crawford&rsquo;s whole declaration with Letter II. in
Scots, he will find that Crawford has sources of information not
yielded by Letter II.; while Letter II. abounds in matter spoken
by Mary and Darnley which could not be borrowed by the
hypothetical forger from Crawford&rsquo;s Declaration, for it does not
contain the facts. These facts, again, in Letter II., are worthless
to a forger, because they concern matters never alluded to in any
of the records; never employed in any indictment (though
Lennox&rsquo;s are copious in private talk between Darnley and Mary,
&ldquo;reports of her servants &ldquo;), and totally useless for the purposes
of the accusers. Here is one of several examples. Letter II. has,
and Crawford has not, the statement that Darnley &ldquo;showed me,
amongst other talk, that he knew well enough that my brother
had revealed to me what he (Darnley) had spoken at Stirling.
Of this he (Darnley) denies half, and above all that he (the
brother?) ever came to his (Darnley&rsquo;s) chamber.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing is known about this matter. The Lennox papers are
full of reports of bitter words that passed between Darnley and
Mary at Stirling (December 1566), where Darnley was sulking
apart while the festivities of the baptism of his son (later
James VI.) were being held. But nothing is said in the Lennox
papers of words spoken by Darnley to Mary&rsquo;s brother (probably
Lord Robert of Holyrood) and revealed by Lord Robert to Mary.
Lord Robert was the only friend of Darnley in Mary&rsquo;s entourage;
and he even, according to the accusers, warned him of his danger
in Kirk o&rsquo; Field, to which they said that a Casket Letter (III.)
referred. The reference is only to be seen by willing eyes.</p>

<p>Is it credible that a forger, using Crawford&rsquo;s Declaration, which
is silent as to Mary&rsquo;s brother at Stirling, should have superfluously
added what is not to any purpose? Could he have combined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page452" id="page452"></a>452</span>
with Crawford&rsquo;s matter the passage &ldquo;he (Darnley) showed me
almost all that is in name of the Bishop and Sutherland, and yet
I have never touched a word of what you (Bothwell) showed
me ... and by complaining of the Bishop, I have drawn it all
out of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Who but Mary herself could have written about this unknown
affair of the Bishop, and what had the supposed forger to gain
by inventing and adding these references to affairs unconnected
with the case?</p>

<p>There remains what looks like absolute proof that, in essence,
Crawford&rsquo;s Declaration and Letter II. are independent documents.
We are not aware that this crucial point has been noticed by the
earlier critics of the Letters. In Letter II. (paragraph 7, p. 398,
in Lang&rsquo;s <i>Mystery of Mary Stuart</i>, 1901) Mary writes, &ldquo;I asked
why he (Darnley) would pass away in the English ship. He
denies it, and swears thereunto; but he grants that he spoke
unto the men.&rdquo; Here Crawford&rsquo;s declaration has, &ldquo;She asked
him why he would pass away in the English ship. He answered
that he had spoken with the Englishman, but not of mind to go
away with him. And, if he had, it had not been without cause,
considering how he was used. For he had neither [means] to
sustain himself nor his servants, and need not make further
rehearsal thereof, seeing she knew it as well as he.&rdquo; (<i>Mystery of
Mary Stuart</i>, p. 429.)</p>

<p>It may seem to the reader doubtful whether these complaints
are words of Darnley&rsquo;s, or an indignant addition by his friend
Crawford. But Mary, in Letter II., shows that the complaints
and the self-defence are Darnley&rsquo;s own. It was in paragraph 7
that she wrote about the English ship; she did not then give
Darnley&rsquo;s remonstrances, as Crawford does. But in paragraph
18 (<i>Mystery</i>, p. 406) Mary returns to the subject, and writes, &ldquo;He
(Darnley) spoke very bravely at the beginning, as the bearer will
show you, upon the subject of the Englishmen, and of his departing;
but in the end he returned to his humility.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus it is certain that Darnley had reported to Crawford his
brave words and reproaches of Mary, which Crawford gives in the
proper place. But Letter II. omits them in that place (paragraph
7); and only on her second day of writing, in paragraph
18, does Mary&rsquo;s mind recur to Darnley&rsquo;s first brave words&mdash;&ldquo;he
spoke very bravely at the beginning,&rdquo; about his wrongs, &ldquo;but in
the end he returned again to his humility.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here is proof positive that Crawford does not copy Letter II.,
but gives Darnley&rsquo;s words as reported to him by Darnley&mdash;words
that Darnley was proud of,&mdash;while Mary, returning on the
second day of writing to the topic, does not quote Darnley&rsquo;s
brave words, but merely contrasts his speaking &ldquo;very bravely
at the beginning&rdquo; with his pitiful and craven later submission;
&ldquo;he has ever the tear in his eye,&rdquo; with what follows. (<i>Mystery</i>,
paragraph 12, p. 402.)</p>

<p>When we add to these and other proofs the strange lists of
memoranda in the middle of the pages of the letter, and the
breach in internal chronology which was apparently caused by
Mary&rsquo;s writing, on her second day, on the clean verso of a page
on the other side of which she had written some lines during her
first night in Glasgow; when we add the dramatic changes of her
mood, and the heart-breaking evidence of a remorse not stifled
by lawless love, we seem compelled to believe that she wrote the
whole of Letter II.; that none of it is forged.</p>

<p>In <i>The Mystery of Mary Stuart</i> the evidence for an early forged
letter was presented with confidence; the interpolation of
forgeries based on Crawford&rsquo;s declaration was more dubiously
suggested. That position the writer now abandons. It may be
asked why, after being with Wood on the 11th of June, did
Lennox still rely on Moray&rsquo;s version of Mary&rsquo;s letter? The reply
may be that the Scots versions were regarded as a great secret;
that Lennox was a married man; and that though Lennox in
June knew about Mary&rsquo;s letters, doubtless from Wood, or from
common report (Bishop Jewell in a letter of August 1567 mentions
that he had heard of them), yet Wood did not show to him the
Scots copies. Lennox quotes Letter II. later, in an indictment
to be read to the commission sitting at York (October 1568).
But, on the other hand, as Lennox after meeting Wood wrote to
Crawford for his reminiscences of his own interview with Mary
(January 21, 1567), and as these reminiscences were only useful
as corroborative of Mary&rsquo;s account in Letter II., it seems that
Wood had either shown Lennox the letters or had spoken of
their contents. In that case, when Lennox later quotes Moray&rsquo;s
version, not Letter II. itself, he is only acting with the self-contradictory
stupidity which pervades his whole indictment
(Oo. 7. 47. fol. 17 b.).</p>

<p>The letters are not known to have been seen by any man&mdash;they
or the silver casket&mdash;after the death of the earl of Gowrie (who
possessed them). In May 1584 Bowes, the English ambassador
to Holyrood, had endeavoured to procure them for Elizabeth,
&ldquo;for the secrecy and benefit of the cause.&rdquo; Conceivably the
letters fell into the hands of James VI. and were destroyed by
his orders.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASLON,<a name="ar144" id="ar144"></a></span> the name of a famous family of English typefounders.
William Caslon (1692-1766), the first of the name, was born at
Cradley, Worcestershire, and in 1716 started business in London
as an engraver of gun locks and barrels, and as a bookbinder&rsquo;s
tool-cutter. Being thus brought into contact with printers,
he was induced to fit up a type foundry, largely through the
encouragement of William Bowyer. The distinction and legibility
of his type secured him the patronage of the leading
printers of the day in England and on the continent. The use
of Caslon types, discontinued about the beginning of the 19th
century, was revived about 1845 at the suggestion of Sir Henry
Cole, and used for printing the <i>Diary of Lady Willoughby</i> (a
pseudo-17th-century story) by the Chiswick Press. The headline
on this page is &ldquo;Caslon Old Face.&rdquo; He died on the 23rd of
January 1766. His son, William Caslon (1720-1778), who had
been partner with his father for some years, continued the

from 46° 50&prime; to 55° 10&prime; E. long. Its length is 760 m. from N.
to S., and its breadth 100 to 280 m., and its area reaches
169,330 sq. m., of which 865 sq. m. belong to its islands. It
fills the deepest part of a vast depression, sometimes known as
the Aralo-Caspian depression, once an inland sea, the Eurasian
Mediterranean or Sarmatian Ocean. At the present time its
surface lies 86 ft. below the level of the ocean, or 96.7 ft. according
to the Aral-Caspian levelling<a name="fa1g" id="fa1g" href="#ft1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and 242.7 ft. below the level of
the Aral.</p>

<p><i>Hydrography and Shores.</i>&mdash;The hydrography of the Caspian
Sea has been studied by von Baer, by N. Ivashintsev (1819-1871)
in 1862-1870, by O. Grimm, N.I. Andrusov (1895), and by J.B.
Spindler (1897), N. von Seidlitz and N. Knipovich (1904)
since the last quoted date. Its basin is divided naturally into
three sections&mdash;(1) A northern, forming in the east the Gulf
of Mortvyi Kultuk or Tsarevich Bay. This is the shallowest
part, barely reaching a depth of 20 fathoms. It is being gradually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page453" id="page453"></a>453</span>
silted up by the sedimentary deposits brought down by the
rivers Volga, Ural and Terek. The western shore, from the delta
of the Volga to the mouth of the Kuma, a distance of 170 m.,
is gashed by thousands of narrow channels or lagoons, termed
<i>limans</i>, from 12 to 30 m. in length, and separated in some cases
by chains of hillocks, called <i>bugors</i>, in others by sandbanks.
These channels are filled, sometimes with sea-water, sometimes
with overflow water from the Volga and the Kuma. The coast-line
of the Gulf of Mortvyi Kultuk on the north-east is, on the
other hand, formed by a range of low calcareous hills, constituting
the rampart of the Ust-Urt plateau, which intervenes between
the Caspian and the Sea of Aral. On the south this gulf is backed
by the conjoined peninsulas of Busachi and Manghishlak,
into which penetrates the long, narrow, curving bay or fjord of
Kaidak or Kara-su. (2) South of the line joining the Bay of
Kuma with the Manghishlak peninsula, in 44° 10&prime; N. lat., the
western shore is higher and the water deepens considerably,
being over one-half of the area 50 fathoms, while the maximum
depth (between 41° and 42° N. lat.) reaches 437 fathoms. This,
the middle section of the Caspian, which extends as far as the
Apsheron peninsula, receives the Terek and several smaller
streams (<i>e.g.</i> Sulak, Samur), that drain the northern slopes of
the Caucasus. At Derbent, just north of 42° lat., a spur of the
Caucasus approaches so close to the sea as to leave room for only
a narrow passage, the <i>Caspiae Pylae</i> or <i>Albanae Portae</i>, which
has been fortified for centuries. The eastern shore of this section
of the sea is also formed by the Ust-Urt plateau, which rises
550 ft. to 750 ft. above the level of the Caspian; but in 42° N.
lat. the Ust-Urt recedes from the Caspian and circles round the
Gulf of Kara-boghaz or Kara-bugaz (also called Aji-darya and
Kuli-darya). This subsidiary basin is separated from the
Caspian by a narrow sandbar, pierced by a strait 1¼ m. long
and only 115 to 170 yds. wide, through which a current flows
continuously into the gulf at the rate of 1½ to 5 m. an hour,
the mean velocity at the surface being 3 m. an hour. To this
there exists no compensating outflow current at a greater
depth, as is usually the case in similar situations. The area of
this lateral basin being about 7100 sq. m., and its depth but
comparatively slight (3½ to 36 ft.), the evaporation is very appreciable
(amounting to 3.2 ft. per annum), and sufficient,
according to von Baer, to account for the perpetual inflow from
the Caspian. South of the Kara-Boghaz Bay the coast rises
again in another peninsula, formed by an extension of the
Balkhan Mountains. This marks (40° N. lat.) the southern
boundary of the middle section of the Caspian. This basin may
be, on the whole, considered as a continuation of the synclinal
depression of the Manych, which stretches along the northern foot
of the Caucasus from the Sea of Azov. It is separated from
(3), the southern and deepest section of the Caspian, by a submarine
ridge (30 to 150 fathoms of water), which links the main
range of the Caucasus on the west with the Kopet-dagh in the
Transcaspian region on the east. This section of the sea washes
on the south the base of the Elburz range in Persia, sweeping
round from the mouth of the Kura, a little north of the Bay of
Kizil-agach, to Astarabad at an average distance of 40 m. from
the foot of the mountains. A little east of the Gulf of Enzeli,
which resembles the Kara-boghaz, though on a much smaller
scale, the Sefid-rud pours into the Caspian the drainage of the
western end of the Elburz range, and several smaller streams
bring down the precipitation that falls on the northern face of
the same range farther to the east. Near its south-east corner
the Caspian is entered by the Atrek, which drains the mountain
ranges of the Turkoman (N.E.) frontier of Persia. Farther
north, on the east coast, opposite to the Bay of Kizil-agach,
comes the Balkhan or Krasnovodsk Bay. In the summer of
1894 a subterranean volcano was observed in this basin of the
Caspian, in 38° 10&prime; N. lat. and 52° 37&prime; E. long. The depth in
this section ranges from 300 to 500 fathoms, with a maximum
of 602 fathoms.</p>

<p><i>Drainage Area and Former Extent.</i>&mdash;The catchment area from
which the Caspian is fed extends to a very much greater distance
on the west and north than it does on the south and east. From
the former it is entered by the Volga, which is estimated to drain
an area of 560,000 sq. m., the Ural 96,000 sq. m., the Terek
59,000 sq. m., the Sulak 7000 sq. m., the Samur 4250 sq. m.;
as compared with these, there comes from the south and east
the Kura and Aras, draining the south side of the Caucasus
over 87,250 sq. m., and the Sefid-rud and the Atrek, both relatively
short. Altogether it is estimated (by von Dingelstedt)
that the total discharge of all the rivers emptying into the
Caspian amounts annually to a volume equal to 174.5 cub. m.
Were there no evaporation, this would raise the surface of
the sea 5½ ft. annually. In point of fact, however, the entire
volume of fresh water poured into the Caspian is only just
sufficient to compensate for the loss by evaporation. Indeed
in recent times the level appears to have undergone several
oscillations. From the researches of Philippov it appears that
during the period 1851-1888 the level reached a maximum on
three separate occasions, namely in 1868-1869, 1882 and 1885,
while in 1853 and 1873 it stood at a minimum; the range of
these oscillations did not, however, exceed 3 ft. 6½ in. The
Russian expedition which investigated the Kara-boghaz in
1896 concluded that there is no permanent subsidence in the
level of the sea. In addition to these periodical fluctuations,
there are also seasonal oscillations, the level being lowest in
January and highest in the summer.</p>

<p>The level of the Caspian, however, was formerly about the
same as the existing level of the Black Sea, although now some
86 ft. below it. This is shown by the evidences of erosion on
the face of the rocks which formed the original shore-line of its
southern basin, those evidences existing at the height of 65 to
80 ft. above the present level. That a rapid subsidence did take
place from the higher level is indicated by the fact that between
it and the present level there is an absence of indications of
erosive energy. There can be no real doubt that formerly the
area of the Caspian was considerably greater than it is at the
present time. Nearly one hundred and fifty years ago Pallas
had his attention arrested by the existence of the salt lakes and
dry saline deposits on the steppes to the east of the Caspian,
and at great distances from its shores, and by the presence in the
same localities of shells of the same marine fauna as that which
now inhabits that sea, and he suggested the obvious explanation
that those regions must formerly have been covered by the
waters of the sea. And it is indeed the fact that large portions
of the vast region comprised between the lower Volga, the Aral-Irtysh
water-divide, the Dzungarian Ala-tau, and the outliers
of the Tian-shan and Hindu-kush systems are actually covered
with Aralo-Caspian deposits, nearly always a yellowish-grey
clay, though occasionally they assume the character of a more or
less compact sandstone of the same colour. These deposits
attain their maximum thickness of 90 ft. east of the Caspian,
and have in many parts been excavated and washed away by
the rivers (which have frequently changed their beds) or been
transported by the winds, which sweep with unmitigated
violence across those wide unsheltered expanses. The typical
fossils unearthed in these deposits are shells of species now living
in both the Caspian and the Aral, though in the shallow parts
of both seas only, namely (according to Ivan V. Mushketov
[1850-1902]) <i>Cardium edule, Dreissena polymorpha, Neritina
liturata, Adacna vitrea, Hydrobia stagnalis</i>, in the Kara-kum
desert, and <i>Lithoglyphus caspius, Hydrobia stagnalis, Anodonta
ponderosa</i> and the sponge <i>Metchnikovia tuberculata</i>, in the Kizil-kum
desert. The exact limits of the ancient Aralo-Caspian sea
are not yet settled, except in the north-west, where the Ergeni
Hills of Astrakhan constitute an unmistakable barrier. Northwards
these marine deposits are known to exist 80 m. away from
Lake Aral, though they do not cross the Aral-Irtysh water-divide,
so that this sea will not probably have been at that time
connected with the Arctic, as some have supposed. The eastern
limits of these deposits lie about 100 m. from Lake Aral, though
Severtsov maintained that they penetrate into the basin of Lake
Balkash. Southwards they have been observed without a break
for 160 m. from Lake Aral, namely in the Sary-kamysh depression
(the surface of which lies below the level of the Caspian) and up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page454" id="page454"></a>454</span>
the Uzboi trench for 100 m. from the latter sea. How far they
reach up the present courses of the Oxus (Amu-darya) and
Jaxartes (Syr-darya) is not known. Hence, it is plain that in late
Tertiary, and probably also in Post-Tertiary, times the Aralo-Caspian
Sea covered a vast expanse of territory and embraced
very large islands (<i>e.g.</i> Ust-Urt), which divided it into an eastern
and a western portion, communicating by one or two narrow
straits only, such as on the south the Sary-kamysh depression,
and on the north the line of the lakes of Chumyshty and Asmantai.
More than this, the Caspian was also, it is pretty certain, at the
same epoch, and later, in direct communication with the Sea of
Azov, no doubt by way of the Manych depression; for in the
<i>limans</i> or lagoons of the Black Sea many faunal species
exist which are not only identical with species that are found in
the Caspian, but also many which, though not exactly identical,
are closely allied. As examples of the former may be named&mdash;<i>Archaeobdella,
Clessinia variabilis, Neritina liturata, Gmelina,
Gammarus moeoticus, Pseudocuma pectinata, Paramysis Baeri,
Mesomysis Kowalevskyi</i> and <i>M. intermedia, Limnomysis Benedeni</i>
and <i>L. Brandt</i>i, and species of the ichthyological fauna <i>Gobius,
Clupea</i> and <i>Acipenser</i>; while as illustrating the latter class
the Black Sea contains <i>Dreissenia bugensis</i> (allied to <i>D. rostriformis</i>
and <i>D. Grimmi), Cardium ponticum</i> (to <i>C. caspium), C. coloratum</i>
(to <i>Monodacna edentula), Amphicteis antiqua</i> (to <i>A. Kowalevskyi</i>)
and <i>Bythotrephes azovicus</i> (to <i>B. socialis</i>).</p>

<p>In the opinion of Russian geologists the separation of the
Caspian from the great ocean must have taken place at a comparatively
recent geological epoch. During the early Tertiary
age it belonged to the Sarmatian Ocean, which reached from
the middle Danube eastwards through Rumania, South Russia,
and along both flanks of the Caucasus to the Aralo-Caspian
region, and westwards had open communication with the great
ocean, as indeed the ancient geographers Eratosthenes, Strabo
and Pliny believed it still had in their day. This communication
began to fail, or close up presumably in the Miocene period;
and before the dawn of Pliocene times the Sarmatian Ocean
was broken up or divided into sections, one of which was the
Aralo-Caspian sea already discussed. During the subsequent
Ice Age the Caspian flowed over the steppes that stretch away
to the north, and was probably still connected with the Black
Sea (itself as yet unconnected with the Mediterranean), while
northwards it sent a narrow gulf or inlet far up the Volga valley,
for Aralo-Caspian deposits have been observed along the lower
Kama in 56° N. lat. Eastwards it penetrated up the Uzboi
depression between the Great and Little Balkhan ranges, so that
that depression, which is strewn (as mentioned above) with
Post-Tertiary marine deposits, was not (as is sometimes supposed)
an old bed of the Oxus, but a gulf of the Caspian. After the
great ice cap had thawed and a period of general desiccation set in,
the Caspian began to shrink in area, and simultaneously its
connexions with the Black Sea and the Sea of Aral were severed.</p>

<p><i>Fauna</i>.&mdash;The fauna of this sea has been studied by Eichwald,
Kowalevsky, Grimm, Dybowski, Kessler and Sars. At the
present time it represents an intermingling of marine and fresh-water
forms. To the former belongs the herring (<i>Clupea</i>), and
to the latter, species of <i>Cyprinus, Perca</i> and <i>Silurus</i>, also a
lobster. Other marine forms are Rhizopoda (<i>Rotalia</i> and
<i>Textillaria</i>), the sponge <i>Amorphina</i>, the <i>Amphicteis</i> worm,
the molluscs <i>Cardium edule</i> and other <i>Cardidae</i>, and some
Amphipods (<i>Cumacea</i> and <i>Mysidae</i>,), but they are forms which
either tolerate variations in salinity or are especially characteristic
of brackish waters. But there are many species inhabiting the
waters of the Caspian which are not found elsewhere. These include
Protozoa, three sponges, Vermes, twenty-five Molluscs, numerous
Amphipods, fishes of the genera <i>Gobias, Benthophilus</i> and <i>Cobitis</i>,
and one mammal (<i>Phoca caspia</i>). This last, together with some
of the <i>Mysidae</i> and the species <i>Glyptonotus entomon</i>, exhibits
Arctic characteristics, which has suggested the idea of a geologically
recent connexion between the Caspian and the Arctic, an
idea of which no real proofs have been as yet discovered. The
Knipovich expedition in 1904 found no traces of organic life
below the depth of 220 fathoms except micro-organisms and a
single Oligochaete; but above that level there exist abundant
evidences of rich pelagic life, more particularly from the surface
down to a depth of 80 fathoms.</p>

<p><i>Fisheries</i>.&mdash;No other inland sea is so richly stocked with fish
as the Caspian, especially off the mouths of the large rivers,
the Volga, Ural, Terek and Kura. The fish of greatest economic
value are sturgeon (four species), which yield great quantities
of caviare and isinglass, the herring, the salmon and the lobster.
The annual catch of the entire sea is valued at an average of one
million sterling. Some 50,000 persons are engaged in this
industry off the mouth of the Volga alone. Seals are hunted
in Krasnovodsk Bay.</p>

<p><i>Salinity</i>.&mdash;The proportion of salt in the water of the Caspian,
though varying in different parts and at different seasons,
is generally much less than the proportion in oceanic water,
and even less than the proportion in the water of the Black Sea.
In fact the salinity of the Caspian is only three-eights of that of
the ocean. In the northern section, which receives the copious
volumes brought down by the Volga, Ural and Terek, the salinity
is so slight (only 0.0075% in the surface layers) that the water
is quite drinkable, its specific gravity being not higher than
1.0016. In the middle section the salinity of the surface layers
increases to 0.015%, though it is of course greater along the
shores. The concentration of the saline ingredients proceeds
with the greatest degree of intensity in the large bays on the east
side of the sea, and more especially in that of Kara-boghaz,
where it reaches 16.3% (Spindler expedition). The bottom
of this almost isolated basin is covered for an area of 1300 sq. m.
with a deposit of Epsom salts (sulphate of magnesia), 7 ft. thick,
amounting to an estimated total of 1,000,000,000 tons. While
the proportion of common salt to sulphate of magnesia is as 11
to 1 in the water of the Black Sea and as 2 to 1 in the Caspian
water generally, it is as 12.8 to 5.03 in the Kara-boghaz. The
salinity of the surface water of the southern section of the
Caspian averages 1.5%.</p>

<p><i>Climate</i>.&mdash;The temperature of the air over the Caspian basin
is remarkable for its wide range both geographically and seasonally.
The January isotherm of 15° F. skirts its northern shore;
that of 40° crosses its southern border. But the winter extremes
go far below this range: during the prevalence of north-east
winds the thermometer drops to -20°, or even lower, on the
surrounding steppes, while on the Ust-Urt plateau a temperature
of -30° is not uncommon. Again, the July isotherm of 75°
crosses the middle section of the Caspian, nearly coinciding with
the January isotherm of 25°, while that of 80° skirts the southern
shore of the sea, nearly coinciding with the January curve of 40°,
so that the mean annual range over the northern section of the
sea is 60° and over the southern section 40°. The former section,
which is too shallow to store up any large amount of heat during
the summer, freezes for three or four months along the shores,
effectually stopping navigation on the lower Volga, but out in the
middle ice appears only when driven there by northerly winds.</p>

<p>The prevalent winds of the Caspian blow from the south-east,
usually between October and March, and from the north and
north-west, commonly between July and September. They
sometimes continue for days together with great violence,
rendering navigation dangerous and driving the sea-water up
over the shores. They also, by heaping up the water at the one
end of the sea or the other, raise the level temporarily and locally
to the extent of 4 to 8 ft. The currents of the Caspian were
investigated by the Knipovich expedition; it detected two of
special prominence, a south-going current along the west shore
and a north-going current along the east shore. As a consequence
of this the temperature of the water is higher on the Asiatic than
on the European side. The lowest temperature obtained was
35°.24 on the bottom in shallow water, the highest 70°.7 on the
surface. But in March the temperature, as also the salinity,
was tolerably uniform throughout all the layers of water. Another
interesting fact ascertained by the same expedition is that the
amount of oxygen contained in the water decreases rapidly with
the depth: off Derbent in the middle section of the sea the
amount diminished from 5.6 cc. per litre at a depth of 100 metres
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page455" id="page455"></a>455</span>
(330 ft.) to 0.32 cc. per litre at a depth of 700 metres (say 2300 ft.).
At the same spot samples of water drawn from the bottom were
found to contain 0.3 cc. of sulphuretted hydrogen per litre. In
the southern section of the sea the decrease is not so rapid. In
this latter section Spindler ascertained in July 1897 that the
temperature of the surface water 60 m. from Baku was 72.9°,
but that below 10 fathoms it sank rapidly, and at 200 fathoms
and below it was constant at 21.2°.</p>

<p><i>Navigation</i>.&mdash;The development of the petroleum industry in
the Apeshron peninsula (Baku) and the opening (1886) of the
Transcaspian railway have greatly increased the traffic across
the Caspian Sea. A considerable quantity of raw cotton is
brought from Ferghana by the latter route and shipped at
Krasnovodsk for the mills in the south and centre of Russia, as
well as for countries farther west. And Russia draws her own
supplies of petroleum, both for lighting and for use as liquid fuel,
by the sea route from Baku. Other ports in addition to those
just mentioned are Astrakhan, on the Volga; Petrovsk, Derbent
and Lenkoran, on the west shore; Enzeli or Resht, and Astarabad,
on the Persian coast; and Mikhailovsk, on the east coast. The
Russians keep a small naval flotilla on the Caspian, all other
nations being debarred from doing so by the treaty of Turkmanchai
(1828).</p>

<p>At various times and by various persons, but more particularly
by Peter the Great, the project has been mooted of cutting a
canal between the Volga and the Don, and so establishing
unrestricted water communication between the Caspian and the
Black Sea; but so far none of these schemes has taken practical
shape. In 1900 the Hydrotechnical Congress of Russia discussed
the plan of constructing a canal to connect the Caspian more
directly with the Black Sea by cutting an artificial waterway
about 22 ft. deep and 180 ft. wide from Astrakhan to Taganrog
on the Sea of Azov.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASS, LEWIS<a name="ar147" id="ar147"></a></span> (1782-1866), American general and statesman,
was born at Exeter, New Hampshire, on the 9th of October 1782.
He was educated at Phillips Exeter Academy, joined his father
at Marietta, Ohio, about 1799, studied law there in the office of
Return Jonathan Meigs (1765-1825), and was admitted to the
bar at the age of twenty. Four years later he became a member
of the Ohio legislature. During the War of 1812 he served under
General William Hull, whose surrender at Detroit he strongly
condemned, and under General W.H. Harrison, and rose from
the rank of colonel of volunteers to be major-general of Ohio
militia and finally to be a brigadier-general in the regular United
States army. In 1813 he was appointed governor of the territory
of Michigan, the area of which was much larger than that of the
present state. This position gave him the chief control of Indian
affairs for the territory, which was then occupied almost entirely
by natives, there being only 6000 white settlers. During the
eighteen years in which he held this post he rendered valuable
services to the territory and to the nation; he extinguished the
Indian title to large tracts of land, instituted surveys, constructed
roads, and explored the lakes and sources of the Mississippi river.
His relations with the British authorities in Canada after the War
of 1812 were at times very trying, as these officials persisted in
searching American vessels on the Great Lakes and in arousing
the hostility of the Indians of the territory against the American
government. To those experiences was largely due the antipathy
for Great Britain manifested by him in his later career. Upon
the reorganization of President Jackson&rsquo;s cabinet in 1831 he
became secretary of war, and held this office until 1836. It fell
to him, therefore, to direct the conduct of the Black Hawk and
Seminole wars. He sided with the president in his nullification
controversy with South Carolina and in his removal of the
Indians from Georgia, but not in his withdrawal of the government
deposits from the United States Bank.</p>

<p>In 1836 General Cass was appointed minister to France, and
became very popular with the French government and people.
In 1842, when the Quintuple Treaty was negotiated by representatives
of England, France, Prussia, Russia and Austria for the
suppression of the slave trade by the exercise of the right of
search, Cass attacked it in a pamphlet entitled &ldquo;An Examination
of the Questions now in Discussion between the American and
British Government Concerning the Right of Search,&rdquo; and
presented to the French government a formal memorial which
was probably instrumental in preventing the ratification of the
treaty by France. In this same year the Webster-Ashburton
treaty between Great Britain and the United States was concluded,
and, as England did not thereby relinquish her claim of
the right to search American vessels, Cass, after having taken
such a decided stand in this controversy, felt himself in an
awkward position, and resigned his post. His attitude on this
question made him very popular in America, and he was a strong,
but unsuccessful, candidate for the Democratic nomination for
the presidency in 1844. From 1845 to 1848 and from 1849 to
1857 he was a member of the United States Senate, and in 1846
was a leader of those demanding the &ldquo;re-annexation&rdquo; of all the
Oregon country south of 54° 40&prime; or war with England, and was
one of the fourteen who voted against the ratification of the
compromise with England at the 49th parallel. He loyally
supported Polk&rsquo;s administration during the Mexican War,
opposed the Wilmot Proviso, and advocated the Compromise
Measures of 1850 and the Kansas-Nebraska Bill of 1854. In his
famous &ldquo;Nicholson letter&rdquo; of December 1847 he made what was
probably the earliest enunciation of the doctrine of &ldquo;popular
sovereignty,&rdquo; namely, that the people of the territories should
decide for themselves whether or not they should have slavery.</p>

<p>In 1848 he received the Democratic nomination for the presidency,
but owing to the defection of the so-called &ldquo;Barnburners&rdquo;
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Free-Soil Party</a></span>) he did not receive the united support of
his party, and was defeated by the Whig candidate, Zachary
Taylor. His name was again prominent before the Democratic
convention of 1852, which, however, finally nominated Franklin
Pierce. On account of his eminently conservative attitude on all
questions concerning slavery, General Cass has been accused of
pandering to the southern Democrats in order to further his
political aspirations. His ideas of popular sovereignty, however,
were not inconsistent with the vigorous Democratic spirit of the
west, of which he was a typical representative, and it is not clear
that he believed that the application of this principle would result
in the extension of slavery. As the west became more radically
opposed to slavery after the troubles in Kansas, Cass was soon
out of sympathy with his section, and when the Republicans
secured control of the legislature in 1857 they refused to return
him to the Senate. President Buchanan soon afterward made
him secretary of state, and in this position he at last had the
satisfaction of obtaining from the British government an acknowledgment
of the correctness of the American attitude with
regard to the right of search (or &ldquo;visitation,&rdquo; as Great Britain
euphemistically termed it). In December 1860 he retired
from the cabinet when the president refused to take a firmer
attitude against secession by reinforcing Fort Sumter, and he
remained in retirement until his death at Detroit, Michigan, on
the 17th of June 1866. He wrote for the <i>North American</i> and
the <i>American Quarterly</i> Reviews, and published <i>Inquiries

<p><span class="bold">CASSABA,<a name="ar148" id="ar148"></a></span> a town of Asia Minor, in the sanjak of Manisa,
63 m. E. of Smyrna, with which it is connected by rail. Pop.
estimated at 23,000, of which two-thirds are Mussulman; but
the estimate is probably excessive. It has considerable local
trade, and exports the products of the surrounding district.
Cotton is the most important article, and there are ginning
factories in the town; the silkworm is largely raised and
exported; and the &ldquo;melons of Cassaba&rdquo; are sent not only to
Smyrna but to Constantinople. There are fragments of marbles
built into the houses, but the modern town does not seem to
occupy any ancient site of importance.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASSAGNAC, BERNARD ADOLPHE GRANIER DE<a name="ar149" id="ar149"></a></span> (1806-1880),
French journalist, was born at Avéron-Bergelle in the
department of Gers on the 11th of August 1806. In 1832 he
began his career as a Parisian journalist, contributing ardent
defences of Romanticism and Conservatism to the <i>Revue de
Paris</i>, the <i>Journal des Débats</i>, and to <i>La Presse</i>. Then he founded
a political journal, <i>L&rsquo;Époque</i> (1845-1848), in which his violent
polemics in support of Guizot brought him notoriety and not
a few duels. In 1851, in the <i>Constitutionnel</i>, he declared himself
openly an imperialist; and in 1852 was elected as &ldquo;official
candidate&rdquo; by the department of Gers. As journalist and
deputy he actively supported an absolutist policy. He demanded
the restoration of religion, opposed the laws in favour
of the press, and was a member of the club of the rue de l&rsquo;Arcade.
In March 1868 he accused the Liberal deputies of having received
money from the king of Prussia for opposing the emperor, and
when called upon for proof, submitted only false or trivial
documents. After the proclamation of the republic (4th of
September 1870) he fled to Belgium. He returned to France
for the elections of 1876, and was elected deputy. He continued
to combat all the republican reforms, but with no advantage to
his party. He died on the 31st of January 1880. In addition
to his journalistic articles he published various historical works,
now unimportant.</p>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">Paul Adolphe Marie Prosper Granier de
Cassagnac</span> (1843-1904), while still young was associated with
his father in both politics and journalism. In 1866 he became
editor of the Conservative paper <i>Le Pays</i>, and figured in a long
series of political duels. On the declaration of war in 1870 he
volunteered for service and was taken prisoner at Sédan. On
his return from prison in a fortress in Silesia he continued
to defend the Bonapartist cause in <i>Le Pays</i>, against both
Republicans and Royalists. Elected deputy for the department
of Gers in 1876, he adopted in the chamber a policy of obstruction
&ldquo;to discredit the republican régime.&rdquo; In 1877 he openly
encouraged MacMahon to attempt a Bonapartist <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i>,
but the marshal&rsquo;s refusal and the death of the prince imperial
foiled his hopes. He now played but a secondary role in the
chamber, and occupied himself mostly with the direction
of the journal <i>L&rsquo;Autorité</i>, which he had founded. He was
not re-elected in 1902, and died in November 1904. His
sons took over <i>L&rsquo;Autorité</i> and the belligerent traditions of the
family.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASSANA, NICCOLÒ<a name="ar150" id="ar150"></a></span> (1659-1714), often called <span class="sc">Nicoletto</span>,
Italian painter, was born at Venice, and became a disciple of his
father, Giovanni Francesco Cassana, a Genoese, who had been
taught the art of painting by Bernardino Strozzi (&ldquo;il Prete
Genovese&rdquo;). Having painted portraits of the Florentine court,
and also of some of the English nobility, Nicoletto was invited
to England, and introduced to Queen Anne, who sat to him for
her likeness, and conferred on him many marks of favour. He
died in London in 1714, having given way to drinking in his
later years. Cassana was a man of the most vehement temper,
and would wallow on the ground if provoked with his work.
One of his principal paintings is the &ldquo;Conspiracy of Catiline,&rdquo;
now in Florence.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASSANDER<a name="ar151" id="ar151"></a></span> (c. 350-297 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>), king of Macedonia, eldest son
of Antipater, first appears at the court of Alexander at Babylon,
where he defended his father against the accusations of his
enemies. Having been passed over by his father in favour of
Polyperchon as his successor in the regency of Macedonia,
Cassander allied himself with Ptolemy Soter and Antigonus,
and declared war against the regent. Most of the Greek states
went over to him, and Athens also surrendered. He further
effected an alliance with Eurydice, the ambitious wife of King
Philip Arrhidaeus of Macedon. Both she and her husband,
however, together with Cassander&rsquo;s brother, Nicanor, were
soon after slain by Olympias. Cassander at once marched
against Olympias, and, having forced her to surrender in Pydna,
put her to death (316). In 310 or 309 he also murdered Roxana
and Alexander, the wife and son of Alexander the Great, whose
natural son Heracles he bribed Polyperchon to poison. He
had already connected himself with the royal family by marriage
with Thessalonica, Alexander the Great&rsquo;s half-sister,
and, having formed an alliance with Seleucus, Ptolemy and
Lysimachus, against Antigonus, he became, on the defeat and
death of Antigonus in 301, undisputed sovereign of Macedonia.
He died of dropsy in 297. Cassander was a man of literary
taste, but violent and ambitious. He restored Thebes after its
destruction by Alexander the Great, transformed Therma into
Thessalonica, and built the new city of Cassandreia upon the
ruins of Potidaea.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASSANDER<a name="ar152" id="ar152"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Cassant</span>), <span class="bold">GEORGE</span> (1513-1566), Flemish
theologian, born at Pitthem near Bruges, went at an early age
to Louvain and was teaching theology and literature in 1541
at Bruges and shortly afterwards at Ghent. About 1549 he
removed to Cologne, where, after a profound study of the
points of difference between the Catholic and reformed churches,
he devoted himself to the project of reunion, thus anticipating
the efforts of Leibnitz. In 1561 he published anonymously
<i>De Officiis pii ac publicae tranquillitatis vere amantis viri in hoc
dissidio religionis</i> (Basel), in which, while holding that no one,
on account of abuses, has a right utterly to subvert the Church,
he does not disguise his dislike of those who exaggerated the
papal claims. He takes his standpoint on Scripture explained
by tradition and the fathers of the first six centuries. At a time
when controversy drowned the voice of reason, such a book
pleased neither party; but as some of the German princes
thought that he could heal the breach, the emperor Ferdinand
asked him to publish his <i>Consultatio de Articulis Fidei inter
Catholicos et Protestantes Controversis</i> (1565), in which, like
Newman at a later date, he tried to put a Catholic interpretation
upon Protestant formularies. While never attacking dogma, and
even favouring the Roman church on the ground of authority,
he criticizes the papal power and makes reflections on practices.
The work, attacked violently by the Louvain theologians on
one side, and by Calvin and Beza on the other, was put on the
Roman Index in 1617. He died at Cologne on the 3rd of
February 1566. The collected edition of his works was published
in 1616 at Paris.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASSANDRA,<a name="ar153" id="ar153"></a></span> in Greek legend, daughter of Priam and Hecuba.
She was beloved of Apollo, who promised to bestow on her the
spirit of prophecy if she would comply with his desires. Cassandra
accepted the proposal; but no sooner had she obtained
the gift than she laughed at the tempter, and refused to   her
promise. Apollo revenged himself by ordaining that her predictions
should be discredited (Apollodorus iii. 12. 5); and hence
it was in vain that on the arrival of Helen she prophesied the ruin
of Troy. On the capture of that city she was ravished by Ajax,
the son of Oïleus, in the temple of Minerva (Strabo vi. p. 264).
In the distribution of the booty, Cassandra fell to the lot of
Agamemnon; but again her foresight was useless, for he would
not believe her prediction that he should perish in his own
country. The prophecy was fulfilled, for both were slain through
the intrigues of Clytaemnestra (<i>Odyssey</i>, xi. 421 ff.). It is to be
noticed that there is no mention in Homer of her prophetic gifts.
Together with Apollo, she was worshipped under the name of
Alexandra.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASSANO ALL&rsquo; IONIO,<a name="ar154" id="ar154"></a></span> a town of Calabria, Italy, in the
province of Cosenza; its railway station (6 m. S. of the town)
is 37 m. N. by E. from the town of Cosenza, while it is 6 m. W.
of Sibari, on the line between Metaponto and Reggio. Pop.
6842. It is very finely situated, 820 ft. above sea-level: the
rock above it is crowned by a medieval castle commanding
beautiful views: a tower is still pointed out as that from which
the stone was thrown which killed Milo, but this rests on an
erroneous identification of Cassano with the ancient Compsa
(<i>q.v.</i>). There are warm sulphurous springs here which are used
for baths.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASSAVA,<a name="ar155" id="ar155"></a></span> the name given to the farinaceous root of two
species of Euphorbiaceous plants, the bitter cassava, <i>Manihot
utilissima</i>, and the sweet cassava, <i>M. Aipi</i>, both highly important
sources of food starches; Manihot is given as the native
Brazilian name in Spanish writings of the 16th century. They
are herbaceous or semi-shrubby perennials with very large
fleshy, cylindrical, tapering roots as much as 3 ft. long and 6 to
9 in. in diameter, and filled with milky juice. The slender stems,
5 to 9 ft. high, bear large spreading long-stalked leaves, with
the blade divided nearly to the base into three to seven long
narrow segments. The plants are probably natives of South
America, but the bitter cassava, which is the more important
of the two in an economic sense, has been introduced into most
tropical regions, and is extensively cultivated in west tropical
Africa and the Malay Archipelago, from which, as well as from
Brazil and other South American states, its starch in the form
of tapioca is a staple article of export. The sap of the bitter
cassava root contains hydrocyanic acid, and the root, being
therefore highly poisonous, cannot be eaten in a fresh condition;
while on the other hand the sweet cassava is perfectly innocuous,
and is employed as a table vegetable. Exposure to heat dissipates
the poisonous principle, and the concentrated juice is in
that state used as the basis of cassareep and other sauces. From
the bitter cassava roots many different food preparations are
made in Brazil. The roots are preserved for use by being simply
cleaned, sliced and dried; from such dried slices manioc or
cassava meal, used for cassava cakes, &amp;c., is prepared by rasping.
The starch also is separated and used for food under the name
of Brazilian arrowroot; and this, when agglomerated into pellets
on hot plates, forms the tapioca (<i>q.v.</i>) of commerce. Cassava
starch has a stellate hilum, which readily distinguishes it under
the microscope from other starches.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASSEL,<a name="ar156" id="ar156"></a></span> a town of northern France in the department of
Nord, 34 m. N.W. of Lille by rail. Pop. (1906) 1844. It stands
on an isolated hill (515 ft.) from which portions of France,
Belgium and England can be seen, with 32 towns and 100 villages,
including St Omer, Dunkirk, Ypres and Ostend. The former
hôtel de ville (1634), the hôtel de la Noble Cour, once the seat of
the jurisdiction of maritime Flanders, now the town-hall, and
the hôtel des ducs d&rsquo;Halluin are the historic buildings of the
town. Cassel has a communal college. Its industrial establishments
include tanneries, oil-mills, salt refineries and breweries,
and there is trade in cattle and butter.</p>

<p>The town, supposed to occupy the site of <i>Castellum Menapiorum</i>,
was a Roman station, as numerous remains of the
Gallo-Roman period attest, and an important centre of roads.
It is frequently mentioned in the wars of the middle ages, and
was the scene of important battles in 1071, when Robert, count
of Flanders, vanquished his rival Arnulf; 1328, when Philip
of Valois defeated the Flemish; and 1677, when William of
Orange was defeated by Philip, duke of Orleans, brother of
Louis XIV. General D.R. Vandamme (1770-1830) was born
in the town.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASSEL,<a name="ar157" id="ar157"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Kassel</span>, a city of Germany, capital of the former
electorate of Hesse-Cassel, and, since its annexation by Prussia
in 1866, capital of the province of Hesse-Nassau. Pop. (1885)
64,083; (1905) 120,446. It is pleasantly situated, in a hilly
and well-wooded country, on both sides of the river Fulda,
over which a stone bridge leads to the lower new town, 124 m.
by rail N.N.E. from Frankfort-On-Main. The river is navigable
for barges, and railways connect the town with all parts of
Germany. The streets of the old town are narrow and crooked,
and contain many picturesque gabled houses, generally of the
17th century, but those of the upper and lower new town, and
the three suburbs, are not surpassed by any in Germany. The
principal streets are the Königs-strasse (5100 ft. long and 60
broad), the Schöne Aussicht, and the Stände-platz (180 ft. broad
with four rows of linden trees). The large Friedrichs-platz is 1000
by 450 ft. in area. In it stands a marble statue of the landgrave
Frederick II. There is a fine view from the open side. The
former residence of the electors (<i>Residenzschloss</i>) fronts this
square, as well as the Museum Fridericianum, with a <i>façade</i>
of Roman-Ionic columns. The museum contains various
valuable collections of curiosities, interesting mosaics, coins,
casts, a library of 230,000 volumes, and valuable manuscripts.
In the cabinet of curiosities there is a complete collection of
clocks and watches from the earliest to the present time. Among
these is the so-called Egg of Nuremberg, a watch made about
1500 by Peter Henlein. Among other public places and buildings
worthy of notice are the Roman Catholic church, with a
splendid interior; the Königs-platz, with a remarkable echo;
the Karls-platz, with the statue of the landgrave Charles; and
the Martins-platz, with a large church&mdash;St Martin&rsquo;s&mdash;with
twin towers, containing the burial-vaults of the Hessian princes.
The gallery of paintings, housed in a handsome building erected
in 1880 on the Schöne Aussicht, contains one of the finest small
collections in Europe, especially rich in the works of Rembrandt,
Frans Hals and Van Dyck.</p>

<p>The town contains numerous educational institutions, including
a technical college, a school of painting, a celebrated classical
school, which the emperor William II. attended, and a military
academy. The descendants of the French refugees who founded
the upper new town have a church and hospital of their own.
There are three Roman Catholic churches, an English church,
and two synagogues. Music is much cultivated, and there is an
opera with a first-rate orchestra, of which Ludwig Spohr was
at one time conductor. The opera-house or theatre was built
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page458" id="page458"></a>458</span>
by Jerome Napoleon, but in 1906 money was voted for a new
building on the Auetor. A new Rathaus (town-hall) has been
erected. There are also the Bose Museum, containing collections
of pictures and antiquities of Hessian origin, museums of natural
history and ethnography, an industrial exhibition hall, and an
industrial art school. A handsome Gothic Lutheran church
was erected in 1892-1897, a post office (Renaissance) in 1881,
and new administrative offices and law courts in 1876-1880.
The municipal (or Murhard) library, in the Hanau park, contains
118,000 volumes. The most noticeable of the modern public
monuments are those to the emperor William I. (1898), to the
musician Spohr (1883), and the Löwenbrunnen (1881). In the
Karlsaue, a favourite public promenade lying just below the
Schöne Aussicht, are the Orangerie and the marble baths.
Cassel is the headquarters of the XI. German army corps, and
has a large garrison. It is a favourite residence for foreigners
and retired officers and government officials. The industries
embrace engine-building, the manufacture of railway carriages
and plant, scientific instruments, porcelain, tobacco and cigars,
lithography, jute-spinning, iron-founding, brewing and gardening.</p>

<p>On a slope of the Habichtswald Mountains, 3 m. W. of Cassel,
and approached by an avenue, is the summer palace of Wilhelmshöhe,
erected in 1787-1794. Napoleon III. resided here, as a
prisoner of war, after the battle of Sedan. The surrounding
gardens are adorned with fountains, cascades, lakes and grottos,
the principal fountain sending up a jet of water 180 ft. high
and 12 in. in diameter. Here also is an interesting building
called the Löwenburg, erected in 1793-1796 in the style of a
fortified castle, and containing among other things portraits
of Tudors and Stuarts. The principal curiosity is the Karlsburg
cascade, which is placed in a broad ravine, thickly wooded on
both sides. A staircase of 900 steps leads to the top. On one
of the landings is a huge rudely-carved stone figure of the giant
Enceladus, and at the top is an octagon building called the
Riesenschloss, surmounted by a colossal copper figure of the
Farnese Hercules, 31 ft. high, whose club alone is sufficiently
capacious to accommodate from eight to ten persons. In different
parts of the park, and especially from the Octagon, charming
views are obtained. The park was first formed by the landgrave
Frederick II., the husband of Mary, daughter of George II. of
England, and was finished by his successor the landgrave William,
after whom it was named.</p>

<p>The earliest mention of Cassel is in 913, when it is referred to
as Cassala. The town passed from the landgraves of Thuringia
to the landgraves of Hesse in the 13th century, becoming one
of the principal residences of the latter house in the 15th century.
The burghers accepted the reformed doctrines in 1527. The
fortifications of the town were restored by the landgrave Philip
the Magnanimous and his son William IV. during the 16th century,
and it was greatly improved by the landgrave Charles
(1654-1730), who welcomed many Huguenots who founded the
upper new town. In 1762 Cassel was captured by the Germans
from the French; after this the fortifications were dismantled
and New Cassel was laid out by the landgrave Frederick II.
In 1807 it became the capital of the kingdom of Westphalia; in
1813 it was bombarded and captured by the Russian general
Chernichev; in 1830, 1831 and 1848 it was the scene of violent
commotions; from 1850 to 1851 it was occupied by the Prussians,
the Bavarians and the Austrians; in 1866 it was occupied by the
Prussians, and in 1867 was made the capital of the newly formed
Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASSELL, JOHN<a name="ar158" id="ar158"></a></span> (1817-1865), British publisher, was born in
Manchester on the 23rd of January 1817. His father was the
landlord of a public-house, and John was apprenticed to a joiner.
He was self-educated, gaining by his own efforts a considerable
acquaintance with English literature and a knowledge of French.
He came to London in 1836 to work at his trade, but his energies
at this time were chiefly centred in the cause of temperance,
for which he was an active worker. In 1847 he established
himself as a tea and coffee merchant, and soon after started
a publishing business with the aim of supplying good literature
to the working classes. From the offices of the firm, which
became in 1859 Messrs. Cassell, Petter, Galpin &amp; Co., were issued
the <i>Popular Educator</i> (1852-1855), the <i>Technical Educator</i>
(1870-1872), the <i>Magazine of Art</i> (1878-1903), <i>Cassell&rsquo;s Magazine</i>
(from 1852), and numerous editions of standard works. A special
feature of Cassell&rsquo;s popular books was the illustration. At the
time of the Crimean War he procured from Paris the cuts used
in <i>L&rsquo;Illustration</i>, and by printing them in his <i>Family Paper</i>
(begun in 1853) secured a large circulation for it. The firm was
converted in 1883 into a limited liability company, under the
name of Cassell &amp; Company, Limited. John Cassell died in
London on the 2nd of April 1865.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASSIA<a name="ar159" id="ar159"></a></span> (Lat. <i>cassia</i>, Gr. <span class="grk" title="kasia">&#954;&#945;&#963;&#943;&#945;</span>), the aromatic bark derived
from <i>Cinnamomum cassia</i>. The greater part of the supply
coming from China, it is sometimes termed Chinese cinnamon.
The bark is much thicker than that of true cinnamon; the taste
is more pungent and the flavour less delicate, though somewhat
similar to that of cinnamon. The properties of cassia bark
depend on the presence of a volatile oil&mdash;the oil of cassia, which
is imported in a fairly pure state as an article of commerce from
Canton. Cassia bark is in much more extensive demand on the
continent of Europe than in Great Britain, being preferred to
cinnamon by southern nations. The chief use of both the
oil and bark is for flavouring liqueurs and chocolate, and in
cooking generally. When ground as a spice it is difficult to
distinguish cassia from cinnamon (<i>q.v.</i>), and it is a common
practice to substitute the cheap common spice for the more
valuable article. <i>Cassia Buds</i>, which have a pleasing cinnamon
flavour, are believed to be the immature fruits of the tree which
yields Chinese cinnamon. They are brought in considerable
quantities from Canton, and used as a spice and in confectionery.
<i>Cassia pulp</i>, used as a laxative, is obtained from the pods of
<i>Cassia fistula</i>, or pudding pipe tree, a native of Africa which is
cultivated in both the East and West Indies. Some confusion
occasionally arises from the fact that <i>Cassia</i> is the generic name
of an extensive genus of leguminous plants, which, in addition
to various other medicinal products, is the source of the senna
leaves which form an important article of materia medica.</p>

(after 410) he founded two religious societies&mdash;a convent for
nuns, and the abbey of St Victor, which during his time is said
to have contained 5000 inmates. In later times his regulations
enjoyed a high reputation, and were adopted by the monks and
nuns of Port Royal. He was eventually canonized; and a
festival in his honour long continued to be celebrated at Marseilles
on the 25th of July. Cassianus was one of the first and most
prominent of the Semi-Pelagians, maintaining that while man
is by nature sinful, he yet has some good remaining in him,
and that, while the immediate gift of God&rsquo;s grace is necessary
to salvation, conversion may also be begun by the exercise of
man&rsquo;s will. He further asserted that God is always willing to
bestow his grace on all who seek it, though, at the same time,
it is true that he sometimes bestows it without its being sought.
These views have been held by a very large part of the church
from his time, and embrace much of the essence of Arminianism.
The style of Cassianus is slovenly, and shows no literary polish,
but its direct simplicity is far superior to the rhetorical affectations
which disfigure most of the writings of that age. At the request
of Castor, bishop of Apt, he wrote two monumental and influential
treatises on the monastic life. The <i>De Institutione Coenobiorum</i>
(twelve books) describes the dress, the food, the devotional
exercises, the discipline and the special spiritual dangers of
monastic life in the East (gluttony, unchastity, avarice, anger,
gloom, apathy, vanity and pride). The <i>Collationes Patrum</i>,
a series of dialogues with the pious fathers of Egypt, deal with
the way in which these dangers (and others, <i>e.g.</i> demons) may
be avoided or overcome. At the desire of Leo (then archdeacon
of Rome) he wrote against Nestorius his <i>De Incarnatione
Domini</i> in seven books.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASSINI,<a name="ar162" id="ar162"></a></span> the name of an Italian family of astronomers, four
generations of whom succeeded each other in official charge of
the observatory at Paris.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Giovanni Domenico Cassini</span> (1625-1712), the first of these,
was born at Perinaldo near Nice on the 8th of June 1625.
Educated by the Jesuits at Genoa, he was nominated in 1650
professor of astronomy in the university of Bologna; he observed
and wrote a treatise on the comet of 1652; was employed by the
senate of Bologna as hydraulic engineer; and appointed by
Pope Alexander VII. inspector of fortifications in 1657, and
subsequently director of waterways in the papal states. His
determinations of the rotation-periods of Jupiter, Mars and
Venus in 1665-1667 enhanced his fame; and Louis XIV.
applied for his services in 1669 at the stately observatory then
in course of erection at Paris. The pope (Clement IX.) reluctantly
assented, on the understanding that the appointment
was to be temporary; but it proved to be irrevocable. Cassini
was naturalized as a French subject in 1673, having begun work
at the observatory in September 1671. Between 1671 and 1684
he discovered four Saturnian satellites, and in 1675 the division
in Saturn&rsquo;s ring (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Saturn</a></span>); made the earliest sustained
observations of the zodiacal light, and published, in <i>Les Éléments
de l&rsquo;astronomie vérifiés</i> (1684), an account of Jean Richer&rsquo;s
(1630-1696) geodetical operations in Cayenne. Certain oval
curves which he proposed to substitute for Kepler&rsquo;s ellipses as
the paths of the planets were named after him &ldquo;Cassinians.&rdquo;
He died at the Paris observatory on the 11th of September 1712.</p>

<p>A partial autobiography left by Giovanni Domenico Cassini was published
by his great-grandson, Count Cassini, in his <i>Mémoires pour

<p><span class="sc">Jacques Cassini</span> (1677-1756), son of Domenico Cassini, was
born at the Paris observatory on the 8th of February 1677.
Admitted at the age of seventeen to membership of the French
Academy of Sciences, he was elected in 1696 a fellow of the
Royal Society of London, and became <i>maitre des comptes</i> in
1706. Having succeeded to his father&rsquo;s position at the observatory
in 1712, he measured in 1713 the arc of the meridian
from Dunkirk to Perpignan, and published the results in a
volume entitled <i>De la grandeur et de la figure de la terre</i> (1720)
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Geodesy</a></span>). He wrote besides <i>Élémens d&rsquo;astronomie</i> (1740),
and died on the 18th of April 1756 at Thury, near Clermont.

him in 1716.</p>

employments, continued the hereditary surveying operations,
and began in 1744 the construction of a great topographical
map of France. The post of director of the Paris observatory
was created for his benefit in 1771, when the establishment
ceased to be a dependency of the Academy of Sciences. Cassini

<p><span class="sc">Jacques Dominique Cassini</span>, Count (1748-1845), son of
César François Cassini, was born at the observatory of Paris on
the 30th of June 1748. He succeeded in 1784 to the directorate
of the observatory; but his plans for its restoration and re-equipment
were wrecked in 1793 by the animosity of the
National Assembly. His position having become intolerable,
he resigned on the 6th of September, and was thrown into prison
in 1794, but released after seven months. He then withdrew to
Thury, where he died, aged ninety-seven, on the 18th of October
1845. He published in 1770 an account of a voyage to America in
1768, undertaken as the commissary of the Academy of Sciences
with a view to testing Pierre Leroy&rsquo;s watches at sea. A memoir in
which he described the operations superintended by him in 1787
for connecting the observatories of Paris and Greenwich by
longitude-determinations appeared in 1791. He visited England
for the purposes of the work, and saw William Herschel at
Slough. He completed his father&rsquo;s map of France, which was
published by the Academy of Sciences in 1793. It served as the
basis for the <i>Atlas National</i> (1791), showing France in departments.
Count Cassini&rsquo;s <i>Mémoires pour servir à l&rsquo;histoire de

<p><span class="bold">CASSIODORUS<a name="ar163" id="ar163"></a></span> (not <i>Cassiodorius</i>), the name of a Syrian
family settled at Scyllacium (Squillace) in Bruttii, where it held
an influential position in the 5th century <span class="sc">a.d.</span> Its most important
member was <span class="sc">Flavius Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorus Senator</span>
(c. 490-585), historian, statesman, and monk. &ldquo;Senator&rdquo;
(not a title) is the name used by himself in his official correspondence.
His father held the offices of <i>comes privatarum</i> and
<i>sacrarum largitionum</i> (controller of the emperor&rsquo;s private revenue
and the public exchequer) under Odoacer, and subsequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page460" id="page460"></a>460</span>
attached himself to Theodoric, by whom he was appointed
<i>corrector</i> (governor) of Bruttii and Lucania, and <i>praefectus
praetorio</i>. The son at an early age became <i>consiliarius</i> (legal
assessor) to his father, and (probably in 507) <i>quaestor</i>, an official
whose chief duty at that time consisted in acting as the mouthpiece
of the ruler, and drafting his despatches. In 514 he was
ordinary consul, and at a later date possibly <i>corrector</i> of his
native province. At the death of Theodoric (526) he held the
office of <i>magister officiorum </i>(chief of the civil service). Under
Athalaric he was <i>praefectus praetorio</i>, a post which he retained
till about 540, after the triumphal entry of Belisarius into
Ravenna, when he retired from public life. With the object of
providing for the transmission of divine and human knowledge
to later ages, and of securing it against the tide of barbarism
which threatened to sweep it away, he founded two monasteries&mdash;Vivarium
and Castellum&mdash;in his ancestral domains at Squillace
(others identify the two monasteries). The special duty which
he enjoined upon the inmates was the acquisition of knowledge,
both sacred and profane, the latter, however, being subordinated
to the former. He also collected and emended valuable MSS.,
which his monks were instructed to copy, and superintended
the translation of various Greek works into Latin. He further
amused himself with making scientific toys, such as sun-dials
and water-clocks. As he is stated to have written one of his
treatises at the age of ninety-three, he must have lived till
after 580. Whether he belonged to the Benedictine order is
uncertain.</p>

<p>The writings of Cassiodorus evince great erudition, ingenuity
and labour, but are disfigured by incorrectness and an affected
artificiality, and his Latin partakes much of the corruptions of
the age. His works are (1) historical and political, (2) theological
and grammatical.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>1. (a) <i>Variae</i>, the most important of all his writings, in twelve
books, published in 537. They contain the decrees of Theodoric and
his successors Amalasuntha, Theodahad and Witigis; the regulations
of the chief offices of state; the edicts published by Cassiodorus
himself when <i>praefectus praetorio</i>. It is the best source of our
knowledge of the Ostrogothic kingdom in Italy (ed. T. Mommsen in
<i>Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Auctores Antiquissimi</i>, xii., 1894;
condensed English translation by T. Hodgkin, 1886).</p>

<p>(b) <i>Chronica</i>, written at the request of Theodoric&rsquo;s son-in-law
Eutharic, during whose consulship (519) it was published. It is a
dry and inaccurate compilation from various sources, unduly partial
to the Goths (ed. T. Mommsen in <i>Mon. Germ. Hist.: Auct. Ant.</i> xi.
pt. i., 1893).</p>

<p>(c) Panegyrics on Gothic kings and queens (fragments ed. L.
Traube in <i>Mon. Germ. Hist.: Auct. Ant.</i> xii.).</p>

<p>2. (a) <i>De Anima</i>, a discussion on the nature of the soul, at the
conclusion of which the author deplores the quarrel between two
such great peoples as the Goths and Romans. It seems to have been
published with the last part of the <i>Variae</i>.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Institutiones divinarun et humanarunt litterarum</i>, an encyclopaedia
of sacred and profane literature for the monks, and a sketch
of the seven liberal arts. It further contains instructions for using
the library, and precepts for daily life.</p>

<p>(c) A commentary on the Psalms and short notes (<i>complexiones</i>)
on the Pauline epistles, the Acts, and the Apocalypse.</p>

<p>(d) <i>De Orthographia</i>, a compilation made by the author in his
ninety-third year from the works of twelve grammarians, ending
with his contemporary Priscian (ed. H. Keil, <i>Grammatici Latini</i>, vii.).</p>

<p>The Latin translations of the <i>Antiquities</i> of Josephus and of the
ecclesiastical histories of Theodoret, Sozomen and Socrates, under
the title of <i>Historia Tripartita</i> (embracing the years 306-439), were
carried out under his supervision.</p>

<p>Of his lost works the most important was the <i>Historia Gothorum</i>,
written with the object of glorifying the Gothic royal house and
proving that the Goths and Romans had long been connected by
ties of friendship. It was published during the reign of Athalaric,
and appears to have brought the history down to the death of
Theodoric. His chief authority for Gothic history and legend was
Ablavius (Ablabius). The work is only known to us in the meagre
abridgment of Jordanes (ed. T. Mommsen, 1882).</p>

in ancient geography the name of islands regarded as
being situated somewhere near the west coasts of Europe. Herodotus
(430 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>) had dimly heard of them. Later writers,
Posidonius, Diodorus, Strabo and others, call them smallish
islands off (Strabo says, some way off) the north-west coast of
Spain, which contained tin mines, or, as Strabo says, tin and
lead mines&mdash;though a passage in Diodorus derives the name
rather from their nearness to the tin districts of north-west
Spain. While geographical knowledge of the west was still scanty
and the secrets of the tin-trade were still successfully guarded
by the seamen of Gades and others who dealt in the metal, the
Greeks knew only that tin came to them by sea from the far west,
and the idea of tin-producing islands easily arose. Later, when
the west was better explored, it was found that tin actually came
from two regions, north-west Spain and Cornwall. Neither of
these could be called &ldquo;small islands&rdquo; or described as off the
north-west coast of Spain, and so the Cassiterides were not
identified with either by the Greek and Roman geographers.
Instead, they became a third, ill-understood source of tin,
conceived of as distinct from Spain or Britain. Modern writers
have perpetuated the error that the Cassiterides were definite
spots, and have made many attempts to identify them. Small
islands off the coast of north-west Spain, the headlands of that
same coast, the Scillies, Cornwall, the British Isles as a whole,
have all in turn been suggested. But none suits the conditions.
Neither the Spanish islands nor the Scillies contain tin, at least
in serious quantities. Neither Britain nor Spain can be called
&ldquo;small islands off the north-west of Spain.&rdquo; It seems most
probable, therefore, that the name Cassiterides represents the
first vague knowledge of the Greeks that tin was found overseas
somewhere in or off western Europe.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASSITERITE<a name="ar166" id="ar166"></a></span> (from the Gr. <span class="grk" title="kassiteros">&#954;&#945;&#963;&#963;&#7984;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>, tin), the mineralogical
name for tin-stone, the common ore of tin. It consists
of tin dioxide, or stannic oxide (SnO<span class="su">2</span>), and crystallizes
in the tetragonal system. The crystals are usually 4-sided or
8-sided prisms, striated vertically, and terminated by pyramids
(fig. 1). Twins, with characteristic re-entrant angles, such as
figs. 2 and 3, are common. Certain slender prismatic crystals,
with an acute 8-sided pyramid, are known in Cornwall as &ldquo;sparable
tin,&rdquo; in allusion to their resemblance to sparable nails,
whilst very slender crystals are termed needle-tin. Occasionally
the mineral occurs in fibrous forms, which pass under the name of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page461" id="page461"></a>461</span>
&ldquo;wood-tin,&rdquo; and these, though not unknown in the matrix,
are generally found as rolled pebbles. By the disintegration of
tin-bearing rocks and vein-stones, the cassiterite passes into the
beds of streams as rolled fragments and
grains, or even sand, and is then known
as stream tin or alluvial tin. This detrital
tin-ore was probably used as a source of
the metal before the primitive miners
had learnt to attack the solid tin-bearing
rocks.</p>

<p>Pure cassiterite may be colourless, or
white, as seen in certain specimens from
the Malay Peninsula; but usually the
mineral is brown or even black, the
colour being referred to the presence of
ferric oxide or other impurity. Occasionally the tin-stone is
red. In microscopic sections the colour is often seen to be disposed
in zones, following the contour of the crystal. A brown
variety, with rather resinous lustre, is termed &ldquo;rosin tin.&rdquo;
The usual lustre of crystals of cassiterite is remarkably splendent,
even adamantine. The mineral has a high refractive index,
and strong bi-refringence. Certain transparent yellow and brown
specimens, cut as gem-stones, exhibit considerable brilliancy.
The hardness of cassiterite is 6.5, so that it cannot be scratched
with a knife, and is nearly as hard as quartz. Its specific gravity
is about 7; and in consequence of this high density, the tin-stone
is readily separated during the process of dressing, from all
the associated minerals, except wolframite, which may, however,
be removed by magnetic separators.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">

<p>Cassiterite usually occurs as veins or impregnations in granitic
rocks, and is especially associated with the quartz-mica rock
called greisen. The usual associates of the tin-stone are quartz,
tourmaline, apatite, topaz, beryl, fluorite, lithia-mica, wolframite,
chalcopyrite, &amp;c. The presence of fluorine in many of these
minerals has led to the opinion that the tin has been derived
in many cases from an acid or granitic magma by the action of
fluorine-bearing vapours, and that cassiterite may have been
formed by the interaction of tin fluoride and water vapour.
Cassiterite occurs as a pseudomorph after orthoclase felspar in
some of the altered granite of Cornwall, and it has occasionally
been found as a cementing material in certain brecciated lodes.</p>

<p>Among the localities yielding cassiterite may be mentioned
Cornwall, Saxony, Bohemia, Brittany, Galicia in Spain; the
Malay peninsula, and the islands of Banca and Billiton; New
South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania. Fine examples of
wood-tin, occurring with topaz, are found in Durango in Mexico.
Deposits of cassiterite under rather exceptional conditions are
worked on a large scale in Bolivia; and it is notable that cassiterite
is found in Liassic limestone near Campiglia Marittima in
Tuscany. Cassiterite has been worked in the York region,
Alaska.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASSIUS,<a name="ar167" id="ar167"></a></span> the name of a distinguished ancient Roman family,
originally patrician. Its most important members are the
following.</p>

<p>1. <span class="sc">Spurius Cassius</span>, surnamed <i>Vecellinus</i> (<i>Vicellinus, Viscellinus</i>),
Roman soldier and statesman, three times consul,
and author of the first agrarian law. In his first consulate
(502 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>) he defeated the Sabines; in his second (493) he renewed
the league with the Latins, and dedicated the temple of Ceres
in the Circus; in his third (486) he made a treaty with the
conquered Hernici. The account of his agrarian law is confused
and contradictory; it is clear, however, that it was intended to
benefit the needy plebeians (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Agrarian Laws</a></span>). As such it
was violently opposed both by the patricians and by the wealthy
plebeians. Cassius was condemned by the people as aiming at
kingly power, and hurled from the Tarpeian rock. Another
account says he was tried by the family council and put to death
by his own father, who considered his proposal prejudicial
to the patrician interest. According to Livy, his proposal
to bestow a share of the land upon the Latins was regarded
with great suspicion. According to Mommsen (<i>Römische Forschungen</i>,
ii.), the whole story is an invention of a later age,
founded upon the proposals of the Gracchi and M. Livius Drusus,
to which period belongs the idea of sharing public land with the
Latins.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>See Livy ii. 33, 41; Dion Halic. v. 49, viii. 69-80; Cicero, <i>Pro
Balbo</i>, 23 (53), <i>De Republica</i>, ii. 27 (49), 35 (60); Val. Max. v. 8. 2.</p>
</div>

<p>The following Cassii are all plebeians. It is suggested that the
sons of Spurius Cassius either were expelled from, or voluntarily
left, the patrician order, in consequence of their father&rsquo;s
execution.</p>

<p>2. <span class="sc">Gaius Cassius Longinus</span>, consul 73 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> With his
colleague, Terentius Varro Lucullus, he passed a law (<i>lex Terentia
Cassia</i>), the object of which was to give authority for the purchase
of corn at the public expense, to be retailed at a fixed price at
Rome. It is doubtful whether this Cassius (who is often called
by the additional name Varus) is identical with the Varus who
was proscribed by the triumvirs, and put to death at Minturnae

<p>3. <span class="sc">Gaius Cassius Longinus</span>, prime mover in the conspiracy
against Julius Caesar. Little is known of his early life. In
53 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> he served in the Parthian campaign under M. Licinius
Crassus, saved the remnants of the army after the defeat at
Carrhae, and for two years successfully repelled the enemy.
In 49 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> he became tribune of the plebs. The outbreak of the
civil war saved him from being brought to trial for extortion
in Syria. He at first sided with Pompey, and as commander
of part of his fleet rendered considerable service in the Mediterranean.
After Pharsalus he became reconciled to Caesar, who
made him one of his legates. In 44 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> he became <i>praetor
peregrinus</i> with the promise of the Syrian province for the
ensuing year.   The appointment of his junior, M. Junius Brutus,
as <i>praetor urbanus</i> deeply offended him, and he was one of the
busiest conspirators against Caesar, taking an active part in the
actual assassination. He then left Italy for Syria, raised a considerable
army, and defeated P. Cornelius Dolabella, to whom
the province had been assigned by the senate. On the formation
of the triumvirate, Brutus and he, with their combined armies,
crossed the Hellespont, marched through Thrace, and encamped
near Philippi in Macedonia. Their intention was to starve out
the enemy, but they were forced into an engagement. Brutus
was successful against Octavian, but Cassius, defeated by M.
Antonius (Mark Antony), gave up all for lost, and ordered his
freedman to slay him. He was lamented by Brutus as &ldquo;the
last of the Romans,&rdquo; and buried at Thasos. A man of considerable
ability, he was a good soldier, and took an interest in literature,
but in politics he was actuated by vanity and ambition.
His portrait in Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>Julius Caesar</i>, though vivid, is
scarcely historical.</p>

in 54 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> In 49, as tribune of the people, he strongly supported
the cause of Caesar, by whom he was made governor of Further
Spain. He treated the provincials with great cruelty, and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page462" id="page462"></a>462</span>
appointment (48) to take the field against Juba, king of Numidia,
gave him an excuse for fresh oppression. The result was an
unsuccessful insurrection at Corduba. Cassius punished the
leaders with merciless severity, and made the lot of the provincials
harder than ever. At last some of his troops revolted under the
quaestor M. Marcellus, who was proclaimed governor of the
province. Cassius was surrounded by Marcellus in Ulia. Bogud,
king of Mauretania, and M. Lepidus, proconsul of Hither Spain,
to whom Cassius had applied for assistance, negotiated an arrangement
with Marcellus whereby Cassius was to be allowed to go
free with the legions that remained loyal to him. Cassius sent his
troops into winter quarters, hastened on board ship at Malaca
with his ill-gotten gains, but was wrecked in a storm at the mouth
of the Iberus (Ebro). His tyrannical government of Spain had
greatly injured the cause of Caesar.</p>

character secured him considerable influence. He was banished
by Nero (65) to Sardinia, because among the images of his
ancestors he had preserved that of the murderer of Caesar. He
was recalled by Vespasian, and died at an advanced age. As he
was consul in 30, he must have been born at the latest in the year
3 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> Cassius was a pupil of Masurius Sabinus, with whom he
founded a legal school, the followers of which were called Cassiani.

<p><span class="bold">CASSIUS, AVIDIUS<a name="ar168" id="ar168"></a></span> (d. <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 175), Roman general, a Syrian
by birth, lived during the reign of Marcus Aurelius. He especially
distinguished himself during the Parthian War (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 162-165),
at the conclusion of which he was apparently appointed military
governor of Asia, though the actual extent of his jurisdiction
is doubtful. In 172 he was sent to Egypt, where he put down a
dangerous rising of the Bucolici, the robber herdsmen of the
delta of the Nile, after which he returned to Syria. In 175 the
emperor Aurelius fell ill, and his wife Faustina, to secure her
position in case of his death, offered her hand and the throne
to the successful general. A rumour of Aurelius&rsquo;s death having
reached Syria, Cassius, without waiting for confirmation, proclaimed
himself emperor; when the report proved false, it was
too late for him to draw back, and he accordingly prepared
for war. The senate declared him a public enemy, although
Aurelius even then expressed the hope that he might have the
opportunity of pardoning him. Deploring the necessity for
taking up arms against his trusted officer, Aurelius set out for
the east. While in Illyria, he received the news that Cassius
had been slain by his own officers. The murderers offered his
head to Aurelius, who refused to admit them, and ordered its
immediate burial.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASSIUS, GAIUS,<a name="ar169" id="ar169"></a></span> Latin poet, general and politician, called
Parmensis from his birthplace Parma, was one of the murderers of
Julius Caesar, and after his death joined the party of Brutus
and his namesake Cassius the conspirator. In 43 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> he was in
command of the fleet on the coast of Asia, but after the battle
of Philippi joined Sextus Pompeius in Sicily. When Pompeius,
having been defeated in a naval engagement at Naulochus by
the fleet of Octavian under Agrippa, fled to Asia, Cassius went
over to Antony, and took part in the battle of Actium (31).
He afterwards fled to Athens, where he was soon put to death
by Octavian, whom he had offended by writing an abusive letter
(Suetonius, <i>Augustus</i>, 4). Cassius is credited with satires, elegies,
epigrams and tragedies. Some hexameters with the title <i>Cassii
Orpheus</i> are by Antonius Thylesius, an Italian of the 17th century.
Horace appears to have thought well of Cassius as a poet, for
he asks Tibullus whether he intends to compete with the <i>opuscula</i>
(probably the elegies) of Cassius (<i>Epistles</i>, i. 4. 3). The story in
the Horace scholia, that L. Varius Rufus published his famous
tragedy <i>Thyestes</i> from an MS. which he found amongst the papers
of Cassius after his death, is due to a confusion of Cassius&rsquo;s
murderer, Q. Attius Varus, with the tragedian (Appian, <i>B.C.</i> v.
2, 139; Cicero, <i>ad Fam.</i> xii. 13; Veil. Pat. ii. 87; Orosius, vi.
19; see also the diffuse treatise of A. Weichert, <i>De L. Varii et
Cassii Parmensis Vita et Carminibus</i>, 1836). Cassius Parmensis
must not be confused with Cassius Etruscus (Horace, <i>Satires</i>, i.
10. 60), an improviser, who is said to have used enough paper to
furnish his funeral pyre.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASSIVELAUNUS,<a name="ar170" id="ar170"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Cassivellaunus</span>, a British chieftain,
ruler of the country north of the Thames, who led the native tribes
against Julius Caesar on his second expedition (54 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>) (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Britain</a></span>). After several indecisive engagements, Caesar took
the camp of Cassivelaunus, who was obliged to make peace on
condition of paying tribute and giving hostages. But these
promises were not meant to be kept, and it appears certain that
the tribute was never paid. According to Bede (<i>Hist. Eccles.</i> i. 2),
the remains of Cassivelaunus&rsquo;s entrenchment were visible seven
or eight centuries later.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASSOCK<a name="ar171" id="ar171"></a></span> (Fr. <i>casaque</i>, a military cloak), a long-sleeved, close-fitting
robe worn by the clergy and others engaged in ecclesiastical
functions. The name was originally specially applied
to the dress worn by soldiers and horsemen, and later to the
long garment worn in civil life by both men and women. As
an ecclesiastical term the word &ldquo;cassock&rdquo; came into use somewhat
late (as a translation of the old names of <i>subtanea, vestis
talaris, toga talaris</i>, or <i>tunica talaris</i>), being mentioned in canon
74 of 1604; and it is in this sense alone that it now survives.
The origin of the word has been the subject of much speculation.
It is derived through the French from the Italian
<i>casacca</i>, which Florio (<i>Q. Anna&rsquo;s New World of Words</i>, 1611)
translates as &ldquo;a frock, a horseman&rsquo;s cote, a long cote; also a
habitation or dwelling,&rdquo; and it is usually held that this in turn
is derived from <i>casa</i>, a house (cf. the derivation of &ldquo;chasuble,&rdquo;
<i>q.v.</i>). This, however, though possible is uncertain. A Slav
origin for the word has been suggested (Hatzfeld and Darmesteter,
<i>Dic. gén. de la langue française</i>), and the Cossack horseman
may have given to the West both the garment and the name.
Or again, it may be derived from <i>casequin</i> (Ital. <i>casecchino</i>), rather
than vice versa, and this in turn from an Arabic <i>kazáyand</i>
(Pers. <i>kasháyand</i>), a padded jerkin; the word <i>kasagân</i> occurring
in Mid. High Ger. for a riding-cloak, and <i>gasygan</i> in O. Fr.
for a padded jerkin (Lagarde in <i>Gott. gelehrte Anzeiger</i>, April 15,
1887, p. 238).</p>

<p>The cassock, though part of the canonical costume of the
clergy, is not a liturgical vestment. It was originally the out-of-doors
and domestic dress of lay-people as well as clergy, and
its survival among the latter when the secular fashions had
changed is merely the outcome of ecclesiastical conservatism.
In mild weather it was the outer garment; in cold weather it
was worn under the tabard or chimere (<i>q.v.</i>) sometimes in the
middle ages the name &ldquo;chimere&rdquo; was given to it as well as to the
sleeveless upper robe. In winter the cassock was often lined
with furs varying in costliness with the rank of the wearer, and
its colour also varied in the middle ages with his ecclesiastical
or academic status. In the Roman Catholic Church the <i>subtanea</i>
(Fr. <i>soutane</i>, Ital. <i>sottana</i>) must be worn by the clergy
whenever they appear, both in ordinary life (except in
Protestant countries) and under their vestments in church.
It varies in colour with the wearer&rsquo;s rank: white for the pope,
red (or black edged with red) for cardinals, purple for bishops,
black for the lesser ranks: members of religious orders, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page463" id="page463"></a>463</span>
whatever their rank, wear the colour of their religious habit.
In the Church of England the cassock, which with the gown is
prescribed by the above-mentioned canon of 1604 as the canonical
dress of the clergy, has been continuously, though not universally,
worn by the clergy since the Reformation. It has long
ceased, however, to be their every-day walking dress and is
now usually only worn in church, at home, or more rarely by
clergy within the precincts of their own parishes. The custom
of wearing the cassock under the vestments is traceable in
England to about the year 1400.</p>

<p>The old form of English cassock was a double-breasted robe
fastened at the shoulder and probably girdled. The continental,
single-breasted cassock, with a long row of small buttons from
neck to hem, is said to have been first introduced into England
by Bishop Harris of Llandaff (1729-1738). The shortened form
of cassock which survives in the bishop&rsquo;s &ldquo;apron&rdquo; was formerly
widely used also by the continental clergy. Its use was forbidden
in Roman Catholic countries by Pope Pius IX., but it
is still worn by Roman Catholic dignitaries as part of their
out-of-door dress in certain Protestant countries.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASSONE,<a name="ar172" id="ar172"></a></span> in furniture, the Italian name for a marriage coffer.
The ancient and once almost universal European custom of
providing a bride with a chest or coffer to contain the household
linen, which often formed the major part of her dowry, produced
in Italy a special type of chest of monumental size and artistic
magnificence. The cassoni of the people, although always large
in size, were simple as regards ornament; but those of the nobles
and the well-to-do mercantile classes were usually imposing as
regards size, and adorned with extreme richness. The cassone
was almost invariably much longer than the English chest, and
even at a relatively early period it assumed an artistic finish
such as was never reached by the chests of northern Europe,
except in the case of a few of the royal <i>corbeilles de mariage</i>
made by such artists as Boulle for members of the house of
France. Many of the earlier examples were carved in panels
of geometrical tracery, but their characteristic ornament was
either <i>intarsia</i> or <i>gesso</i>, or a mixture of the two. Bold and
massive feet, usually shaped as claws, lioncels, or other animals
are also exceedingly characteristic of cassoni, most of which are
of massive and sarcophagus-like proportions with moulded lids,
while many of them are adorned at their corners with figures
sculptured in high relief. The scroll-work inlay is commonly
simple and graceful, consisting of floral or geometrical motives, or
arabesques. The examples coated with gilded <i>gesso</i> or blazoned
with paintings are, however, the most magnificent. They were
often made of chestnut, and decorated with flowers and foliage
in a relief which, low at first, became after the Renaissance very
high and sharp. The panels of the painted cassoni frequently
bore representations of scriptural and mythological subjects,
or incidents derived from the legends of chivalry. Nor was
heraldry forgotten, the arms of the family for which the chest
was made being perhaps emblazoned upon the front. These
chests rarely bear dates or initials, but it is often possible to
determine their history from their armorial bearings.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASSOWARY<a name="ar173" id="ar173"></a></span> (<i>Casuarius</i>), a genus of struthious birds, only
inferior in size to the emeu and ostrich, and, according to Sir R.
Owen, approximating more closely than any other living birds
to the extinct moas of New Zealand. The species are all characterized
by short rudimentary wings, bearing four or five barbless
shafts, a few inches long, and apparently useless for purposes of
flight, of running, or of defence; and by loosely webbed feathers,
short on the neck, but of great length on the rump and back,
whence they descend over the body forming a thick hair-like
covering. They possess stout limbs, with which they kick in
front, and have the inner toe armed with a long powerful claw.
The common cassowary (<i>Casuarius galeatus</i>) stands 5 ft. high,
and has a horny, helmet-like protuberance on the crown of its
head; the front of the neck is naked and provided with two
brightly-coloured wattles. It is a native of the Island of Ceram,
where it is said to live in pairs, feeding on fruits and herbs, and
occasionally on small animals. The mooruk, or Bennett&rsquo;s
cassowary (<i>Casuarius Bennettii</i>), is a shorter and more robust
bird, approaching in the thickness of its legs to the moas. It
differs further from the preceding species in having its head
crowned with a horny plate instead of a helmet. It has only
been found in New Britain, where the natives are said to regard
it with some degree of veneration. When captured by them
shortly after being hatched, and reared by the hand, it soon
becomes tame and familiar; all the specimens which have
reached Europe alive have been thus domesticated by the natives.
The adult bird in the wild state is exceedingly shy and difficult
of approach, and, owing to its great fleetness and strength, is
rarely if ever caught. It eats voraciously, and, like the ostrich,
will swallow whatever comes in its way. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Emeu</a></span>.)</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CAST<a name="ar174" id="ar174"></a></span> (from the verb meaning &ldquo;to throw&rdquo;; the word is Scand.
in origin, cf. Dan. <i>kaste</i>, and Swed. <i>kasta</i>; &ldquo;cast&rdquo; in Middle
Eng. took the place of the A.S. <i>weorpan</i>, cf. Ger. <i>werfen</i>), a throw,
or that which is thrown, or that into which something is thrown.
From these three meanings come the main uses of the word; for
the throwing of dice, with the figurative sense of a chance or
opportunity, as in &ldquo;at the last cast&rdquo;; for the throwing of a
fisherman&rsquo;s line in fly-fishing; for hounds spreading out in
search of a lost scent; or, with the further meaning of a twisted
throw or turn, for a slight squint in the eye. &ldquo;Cast&rdquo; is applied
to a measure of herrings or other fish, being the amount taken in
two hands to be thrown into a vessel, and similarly to a potter&rsquo;s
measure for a certain quantity of clay; in fishing, to the casting
line of gut with fly attached; to the hard refuse thrown out of the
crop of a bird of prey, and to the coils of earth thrown up by
earth-worms. From the old method, in making calculations, of
using counters, which were thus &ldquo;thrown&rdquo; up into a heap, is
probably derived the meaning of &ldquo;cast&rdquo; for the &ldquo;casting up&rdquo;
of figures in an account. Further, the word is found for a mould
for the casting of metals, and more particularly for the copy of
an original statue or relief taken from a mould; similarly, of
fossils, for the mineral filling of the empty mould left by the
organism. Special uses of the word are also found in the
theatrical term for the assignment of particular parts to the
actors and actresses in a play, and in the many figurative senses
of a type or stamp, as of features or characters.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASTAGNO, ANDREA DEL<a name="ar175" id="ar175"></a></span> (1390-1457), Italian painter of the
Florentine school, was born in 1390, probably at Castagno, in
the district of Mugello, and died in August 1457. He imitated
Masaccio and the naturalists of his time in boldness of attitude,
but was deficient in grace and colouring. His name was for about
four centuries burdened with the heinous charge of murder; it
was said that he treacherously assassinated his colleague,
Domenico Veneziano, in order to monopolize the then recent
secret of oil painting as practised in Flanders by the Van Eycks.
This charge has, however, been proved to be an untruth;
Domenico died four years after Andrea. The latter is commonly
called &ldquo;Andrea (or Andreino) degl&rsquo; Impiccati&rdquo; (of the Hanged
Men); this was in consequence of his being commissioned in
1435 to paint, in the Palazzo del Podestà in Florence, the fallen
leaders of the Peruzzi and Albizzi&mdash;not (as currently said) the
men of the Pazzi conspiracy, an event which did not occur until
1478, long after this painter&rsquo;s death. One of his principal works
now extant (most of them have perished) is the equestrian figure
of Nicola di Tolentino, in the cathedral of Florence.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASTALIA,<a name="ar176" id="ar176"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Fons Castalius</span>, a celebrated fountain in
Greece, now called the Fountain of St John, which rises in a
chasm of Mount Parnassus, in the neighbourhood of Delphi.
It was sacred to Apollo and the Muses, and its water was used in
the religious purifications of the &ldquo;Pythian Pilgrims.&rdquo; From its
connexion with the Muses it is sometimes referred to by late
Greek writers (<i>e.g.</i> Lucian, <i>Jup. Trag.</i> 30) and Latin poets (<i>e.g.</i>
Ovid, <i>Am.</i> i. 15. 36) as a source of inspiration, and this has passed
into a commonplace of modern literature. According to some
authorities the nymph Castalia was the daughter of Achelous;
according to others the water of the spring was derived from the
Boeotian Cephissus.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASTANETS<a name="ar177" id="ar177"></a></span> (Fr. <i>castagnettes</i>, Ger. <i>Kastagnetten</i>, Span.
<i>castañuelas</i>), instruments of percussion, introduced through the
Moors by way of Spain into Europe from the East, used for
marking the rhythm in dancing. Castanets, always used in
pairs, one in each hand, consist of two pear or mussel-shaped
bowls of hard wood, hinged together by a silk cord, the loop
being passed over the thumb and first finger. The two halves
are then struck against each other by the other fingers in single,
double or triple beats, giving out series of hollow clicks of
indefinite musical pitch. When intended for use in the orchestra
the pair of castanets is mounted one at each end of a wooden
stick about 8 in. long, which facilitates the playing. Castanets
are also sometimes used in military bands and are then specially
constructed. The two halves are kept open by a slight spring
fixed to a frame attached to the hoop of a side drum, and the
instrument is worked by the drummer with an ordinary drum-stick.
An instance of the use of castanets in opera occurs in the
Habanera in <i>Carmen</i>. A quaint description of <i>castinatts</i> is
given in Harleian MS. 2034 (f. 208) at the British Museum
(before 1688) with a pencil sketch which tallies very well with
the above. The MS. is by Randle Holme and forms part of the
<i>Academy of Armoury</i>. Castanets (<span class="grk" title="krotala">&#954;&#961;&#8000;&#964;&#945;&#955;&#945;</span>) were used by the
ancient Greeks, and also by the Romans (Lat. <i>crotalum, crotala</i>)
to accompany the dances in the Dionysiac and Bacchanalian
rites.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASTE<a name="ar178" id="ar178"></a></span> (through the Fr. from Span, and Port, <i>casta</i>, lineage,
Lat. <i>castus</i>, pure). There are not many forms of social organization
on a large scale to which the name &ldquo;caste&rdquo; has not been
applied in a good or in a bad sense. Its Portuguese origin
simply suggests the idea of family; but before the word came
to be extensively used in modern European languages, it had
been for some time identified with the Brahmanic division of
Hindu society into classes. The corresponding Hindu word is
<i>varna</i>, or colour, and the words <i>gati, kula, gotra, pravara</i> and
<i>karana</i> are also used with different shades of meaning. Wherever,
therefore, a writer has seen something which reminds him of any
part of the extremely indeterminate notion, Indian caste, he has
used the word, without regard to any particular age, race,
locality or set of social institutions. Thus Palgrave<a name="fa1i" id="fa1i" href="#ft1i"><span class="sp">1</span></a> maintains
that the colleges of operatives, which inscriptions prove to have
existed in Britain during the Roman period, were practically
castes, because by the Theodosian code the son was compelled
to follow the father&rsquo;s employment, and marriage into a family
involved adoption of the family employment. But these
<i>collegia opificum</i> seem to be just the forerunners of the voluntary
associations for the regulation of industry and trade, the frith-gilds,
and craft-gilds of later times, in which, no doubt, sons had
great advantages as apprentices, but which admitted qualified
strangers, and for which intermarriage was a matter of social
feeling. The history of the formation of gilds shows, in fact,
that they were really protests against the authoritative regulation
of life from without and above. In the Saxon period, at any
rate, there was nothing resembling caste in the strict sense.
&ldquo;The ceorl who had thriven so well as to have five hides of land
rose to the rank of a thegn; his wergild became 1200 shillings;
the value of his oath and the penalty of trespass against him
increased in proportion; his descendants in the third generation
became gesithcund. Nor was the character of the thriving
defined; it might, so far as the terms of the custom went, be
either purchase, or inheritance, or the receipt of royal bounty.
The successful merchant might also thrive to thegn-right. The
thegn himself might also rise to the rank, the estimation and
status of an earl.&rdquo;<a name="fa2i" id="fa2i" href="#ft2i"><span class="sp">2</span></a> It has been said that early German history
is, as regards this matter, in contrast with English, and that true
castes are to be found in the military associations (<i>Genossenschaften</i>)
which arose from the older class of Dienstmannen, and
in which every member&mdash;page, squire or knight&mdash;must prove
his knightly descent; the Bauernstand, or rural non-military
population; the Bürgerstand, or merchant-class. The ministry
of the Catholic Church in the West, was, however, never restricted
by blood relation. There is no doubt that at some time or other
professions were in most countries hereditary. Thus Prescott<a name="fa3i" id="fa3i" href="#ft3i"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
tells us that in Peru, notwithstanding the general rule that every
man should make himself acquainted with the various arts,
&ldquo;there were certain individuals carefully trained to those
occupations which minister to the wants of the more opulent
classes. These occupations, like every other calling and office
in Peru, always descended from father to son. The division of
castes was in this particular as precise as that which existed in
Hindustan or Egypt.&rdquo; Again, Zurita<a name="fa4i" id="fa4i" href="#ft4i"><span class="sp">4</span></a> says that in Mexico no
one could carry on trade except by right of inheritance, or by
public permission. The Fiji carpenters form a separate caste,
and in the Tonga Islands all the trades, except tattoo-markers,
barbers and club-carvers are hereditary,&mdash;the separate classes
being named matabooles, mooas and tooas. Nothing is more
natural than that a father should teach his son his handicraft,
especially if there be no organized system of public instruction;
it gives the father help at a cheap rate, it is the easiest introduction
to life for the son, and the custom or reputation of the
father as a craftsman is often the most important legacy he has
to leave. The value of transmitted skill in the simple crafts
was very great; and what was once universal in communities
still survives in outlying portions of communities which have
not been brought within the general market of exchange. But
so long as this process remains natural, there can be no question
of caste, which implies that the adoption of a new profession is
not merely unusual, but wrong and punishable. Then, the word
caste has been applied to sacred corporations. A family or a
tribe is consecrated to the service of a particular altar, or all
the altars of a particular god. Or a semi-sacred class, such as the
Brehons or the Bards, is formed, and these, and perhaps some
specially dignified professions, become hereditary, the others
remaining free. Thus in Peru, the priests of the Sun at Cuzco
transmitted their office to their sons; so did the Quipu-camayoc,
or public registrars, and the <i>amantas</i> and <i>haravecs</i>, the learned
men and singers.<a name="fa5i" id="fa5i" href="#ft5i"><span class="sp">5</span></a> In many countries political considerations,
or distinctions of race, have prevented intermarriage between
classes. Take, for example, the patricians and the plebeians at
Rome, or the <span class="grk" title="Spartiatai, Lakônes">&#931;&#960;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#953;&#8118;&#964;&#945;&#953;, &#923;&#940;&#954;&#969;&#957;&#949;&#962;</span> or <span class="grk" title="perioikoi">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#953;</span>, and the
<span class="grk" title="Heilôtes">&#917;&#7989;&#955;&#969;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> at Sparta. In Guatemala it was the law that if any
noble married a plebeian woman he should be degraded to the
caste of <i>mazequal</i>, or plebeian, and be subject to the duties and
services imposed on that class, and that the bulk of his estate
should be sequestered to the king.<a name="fa6i" id="fa6i" href="#ft6i"><span class="sp">6</span></a> In Madagascar marriage
is strictly forbidden between the four classes of Nobles, Hovas,
Zarahovas and Andevos,&mdash;the lowest of whom, however, are
apparently mere slaves. In a sense slavery might be called the
lowest of castes, because in most of its forms it does permit some
small customary rights to the slave. In a sense, too, the survival
in European royalty of the idea of &ldquo;equality of birth&rdquo; (<i>Ebenbürtigkeit</i>)
is that of a caste conception, and the marriage of one of
the members of a European royal family with a person not of
royal blood might be described as an infraction of caste rule.</p>

<p>Caste in India is a question of more than historical interest.
It is the great obstacle to government in accordance with modern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page465" id="page465"></a>465</span>
ideas, and to the work of native religious reformers as well as of
Christian missionaries. By some writers caste has been regarded
as the great safeguard of social tranquillity, and therefore as the
indispensable condition of the progress in certain arts and
industries which the Hindus have made. Others, such as James
Mill, have denounced it as fatal to the principle of free competition
and opposed to individual happiness. The latter view
assumes a state of facts which was denied by Colebrooke, one of
the highest authorities on Indian matters. Writing in 1798 he
says,<a name="fa7i" id="fa7i" href="#ft7i"><span class="sp">7</span></a> after pointing out that any person unable to earn a subsistence
by the exercise of his profession may follow the trade of
a lower caste or even of a higher: &ldquo;Daily observation shows even
Brahmans exercising the menial profession of a Sudra. We are
aware that every caste forms itself into clubs or lodges, consisting
of the several individuals of that caste residing within a small
distance, and that these clubs or lodges govern themselves
by particular rules or customs or by-laws. But though some
restrictions and limitations, not founded on religious prejudices,
are found among their by-laws, it may be received as a general
maxim that the occupation appointed for each tribe is entitled
merely to a preference. Every profession, with few exceptions,
is open to every description of persons; and the discouragement
arising from religious prejudices is not greater than what exists
in Great Britain from the effects of municipal and corporation
laws. In Bengal the numbers of people actually willing to apply
to any particular occupation are sufficient for the unlimited
extension of any manufacture.&rdquo; This was corroborated by
Elphinstone,<a name="fa8i" id="fa8i" href="#ft8i"><span class="sp">8</span></a> who states that, during a long experience of India,
he never heard of a single case of degradation from caste; and it
is illustrated by the experience of the Indian army, in which men
of all castes unite.<a name="fa9i" id="fa9i" href="#ft9i"><span class="sp">9</span></a></p>

<p>The ordinary notion of modern caste is that it involves certain
restrictions on marriage, on profession, and on social intercourse,
especially that implied in eating and drinking together. How
far intermarriage is permitted, what are the effects of a marriage
permitted but looked on as irregular, what are the penalties of a
marriage forbidden, whether the rules protecting trades and
occupations are in effect more than a kind of unionism grown
inveterate through custom, by what means caste is lost, and in
what circumstances it may be regained,&mdash;these are questions on
which very little real or definite knowledge exists. Sir H. Risley
regards the absolute prohibition of mixed marriages as now the
essential and most prominent characteristic. It is very remarkable
that the Vedas, on which the whole structure of Brahmanic
faith and morals professes to rest, give no countenance to the
later regulations of caste. The only passage bearing on the
subject is in the Purusha Sukta, the 90th Hymn of the 10th Book
of the Rigveda Samhita. &ldquo;When they divided man, how many
did they make him? What was his mouth? what his arms?
what are called his thighs and feet? The Brahmana was his
mouth, the Raganya was made his arms, the Vaisya became his
thighs, the Sudra was born from his feet.&rdquo; Martin Haug finds in
this a subtle allegory that the Brahmans were teachers, the
Kshatriyas the warriors of mankind. But this is opposed to the
simple and direct language of the Vedic hymns, and to the fact
that in the accounts of creation there the origin of many things
besides classes of men is attributed in the same fanciful manner
to parts of the divine person. It is in the Puranas and the Laws
of Manu, neither of which claims direct inspiration, where they
differ from the letter of the Veda, that the texts are to be found
on which all that is objectionable in caste has been based. Even
in the Vishnu Purana, however, the legend of caste speaks of the
four classes as being at first &ldquo;perfectly inclined to conduct
springing from religious faith.&rdquo; It is not till after the whole
human race has fallen into sin that separate social duties are
assigned to the classes. The same hymn speaks of the evolution
of qualities of Brahma. Sattva, or goodness, sprang from the
mouth of Brahma; Rajas, or passion, came from his breast;
Tamas, or darkness, from his thighs; others he created from his
feet. For each one of these gunas, or primitive differences of
quality, a thousand couples, male and female, have been created,
to which the distinct heavens, or places of perfection of Prajapati,
Indra, Maruts and Gandharvas are assigned. To the gunas are
related the yugas, or ages: 1st, the Krita, or glorious age of
truth and piety, in which apparently no distinctions, at least no
grades of excellence were known; 2nd, the Treta, or period of
knowledge; 3rd, the Dvapara, or period of sacrifice; 4th, the
Kali, or period of darkness. Bunsen supposes there may be an
historical element in the legend that Pururava, a great conqueror
of the Treta age, founded caste. The yugas are hardly periods of
historical chronology, but there is no doubt that the Vayu
Purana assigns the definite origin of caste to the Treta period.
&ldquo;The perfect beings of the first age, some tranquil, some fiery,
some active and some distressed, were again born in the Treta,
as Brahmans, &amp;c., governed by the good and bad actions performed
in former births.&rdquo; The same hymn proceeds to explain
that the first arrangement did not work well, and that a second
was made, by which force, criminal justice and war were declared
to be the business of the Kshatriyas; officiating at sacrifices,
sacred study and the receipt of presents to belong to the
Brahmans; traffic, cattle and agriculture to the Vaisyas; the
mechanical arts and service to the Sudras. The Ramayana hymn
suggests that in the four great periods the castes successively arrive
at the state of <i>dharma</i> or righteousness. Thus, a Sudra cannot,
even by the most rigorous self-mortification, become righteous in
the period proper to the salvation of the Vaisyas. As the hymn
speaks in the Dvapara age, it speaks of the salvation of Sudras
as future, and not yet possible. Wholly in opposition to the story
of a fourfold birth from Brahma is the legend that the castes
sprang from Manu himself, who is removed by several generations
of gods and demi-gods from Brahma. Then, again, the Santiparvan
alleges that the world, at first entirely Brahmanic, was
separated into castes merely by the evil works of man. Castehood
consists in the exercise of certain virtues or vices. <i>Munis</i>, or
persons born indiscriminately, frequently rise to the caste of
Brahmans, and the offspring of Brahmans sink to a lower level.
The serpent observes: &ldquo;If a man is regarded by you as being a
Brahman only in consequence of his conduct, then birth is vain,
until action is shown.&rdquo; But this change of caste takes place only
through a second, birth, and not during the life which is spent in
virtue. Another poetical conception of caste birth is expressed
in the Harivamsa. The Brahmans were formed from an imperishable
element (Akshara), the Kshatriyas from a perishable
element (Kshara), the Vaisyas from alteration, and the Sudras
from a modification of smoke.</p>

<p>The general result of the foregoing texts is that several contradictory
accounts have been given of the origin of caste, and that
these are for the most part unintelligible. Caste is described as
a late episode in creation, and as born from different parts of
different gods, from the mortal Manu, from abstract principles,
and from non-entity. It is also described as coeval with creation,
as existing in perfection during the Krita period, and subsequently
falling into sin. It is also said that only Brahmans existed at first,
the others only at later periods. Then the rationalistic theories of
the Santiparvan upset the very foundation of caste, viz. hereditary
transmission of the caste character.<a name="fa10i" id="fa10i" href="#ft10i"><span class="sp">10</span></a> It seems clear that when
the Vedas were composed, many persons who were not Brahmans
acted as priests, and saints, the &ldquo;preceptors of gods,&rdquo; by their
&ldquo;austere fervour,&rdquo; rose from a lower rank to the dignity of
Brahmanhood. Originally, indeed, access to the gods by prayer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page466" id="page466"></a>466</span>
and sacrifice was open to all classes of the community. As the
Brahmans grow in political importance, they make religion an
exclusive and sacred business. We find them deciding questions
of succession to the throne, and enforcing their decisions. While
in the earlier literature there are several instances of Brahmans
receiving instruction from the hands of Kshatriyas, in the Puranas
and Manu death is made to overtake Kshatriyas who are not
submissive to the Brahmans; and in one case Visvamitra, the
son of Gadhi, actually obtains Brahmanhood as a reward for his
submission. It seems certain that many of the ancient myths
were expressly manufactured by the Brahmans to show their
superiority in birth and in the favour of Heaven to the Kshatriyas&mdash;a
poetical effect which is sometimes spoiled by their claiming
descent from their rivals. This brings us to a consideration of
the theories which have been started to account for the appearance
of Brahmanic caste, as it is stereotyped in the Laws of Manu.
James Mill, who invariably underestimated the influence on
history of &ldquo;previous states of society,&rdquo; suggested that the
original division must have been the work of some inspired
individual, a legislator or a social reformer, who perceived the
advantages which would result from a systematic division of
labour. The subordination of castes he accounts for by the
superstitious terror and the designing lust of power which have
so frequently been invoked to explain the natural supremacy of
the religious class. Because the ravages of war were dreaded
most after the calamities sent by heaven, he finds that the
military class properly occupy the second place. This arrangement
he apparently contemplates as at no time either necessary
or wholesome, and as finally destroyed by the selfish jealousies
of caste, and by the degradations which the multiplication of
trades made inevitable. Heeren<a name="fa11i" id="fa11i" href="#ft11i"><span class="sp">11</span></a> and Klaproth have contended
that the division into castes is founded on an original diversity
of race, and that the higher castes are possessed of superior
beauty. The clear complexion and regular features of the Brahmans
are said to distinguish them as completely from the Sudras
as the Spanish Creoles were distinguished from the Peruvians.
&ldquo;The high forehead, stout build, and light copper colour of the
Brahmins and other castes allied to them, appear in strong contrast
with the somewhat low and wide heads, slight make, and
dark bronze of the low castes&rdquo; (Stevenson, quoted by Max Müller,
<i>Chips</i>, ii. p. 327).<a name="fa12i" id="fa12i" href="#ft12i"><span class="sp">12</span></a> This explanation is, however, generally
conjoined with that founded on the tradition of conquest by the
higher castes. There is no doubt that the three castes of lighter
colour (traivarnika), the white Brahmans, the red Kshatriyas,
the yellow Vaisyas, are, at least in the early hymns and Brahmanas,
spoken of as the Aryas, the Sanskrit-speaking conquerors,
in contradistinction to the dark cloud of the Turanian aborigines
Dasyus. In fact ârya, which means noble, is derived from &#259;rya,
which means householder, and was the original name of the
largest caste, now called Vaisyas. The great <span class="correction" title="amended from Sanscrit">Sanskrit</span> scholar,
Rudolf von Roth (1821-1895), in his <i>Brahma und die Brahmanan</i><a name="fa13i" id="fa13i" href="#ft13i"><span class="sp">13</span></a>
held that the Vedic people advanced from their home in
the Punjab, drove the aborigines into the hills, and took possession
of the country lying between the Ganges, the Jumna and the
Vindhya range. &ldquo;In this stage of complication and disturbance,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;power naturally fell into the hands of those who did
not possess any direct authority,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> the domestic priests of
the numerous tribal kings. The Sudras he regarded as a conquered
race, perhaps a branch of the Aryan stock, which immigrated
at an earlier period into India, perhaps an autochthonous
Indian tribe. The latter hypothesis is opposed to the fact that,
while the Sudra is debarred from sharing three important Vedic
sacrifices, the Bhagasata Purana expressly permits him to
sacrifice &ldquo;without <i>mantras</i>,&rdquo; and imposes on him duties with
reference to Brahmans and cows which one would not expect in
the case of a nation strange in blood. But unless a previous
subordination of castes among the conquering race be supposed,
it seems difficult to see why the warrior-class, who having
contributed most to the conquest must have been masters of the
situation, should have consented to degradation below the class
of Brahmans. The position of the Sudra certainly suggests
conquest. But are there sound historical reasons for supposing
that Brahmans and Sudras belonged to different nations, or that
either class was confined to one nation? The hypothesis was
held in a somewhat modified form by Meiners,<a name="fa14i" id="fa14i" href="#ft14i"><span class="sp">14</span></a> who supposed
that instead of one conquest there may have been two successive
immigrations,&mdash;the first immigrants being subdued by the second,
and then forming an intermediate class between their conquerors
and the aborigines; or, if there were no aborigines, the mixture
of the two immigrant races would form an intermediate class.
In the same way Talboys Wheeler<a name="fa15i" id="fa15i" href="#ft15i"><span class="sp">15</span></a> suggested that the Sudra
may be the original conquerors of the race now represented by
the Pariahs. Most of these explanations seem rather to describe
the mode in which the existing institutions of caste might be
transplanted from one land to another, from a motherland to its
colonies, and altered by its new conditions. Military conquest,
though it often introduces servitude, does not naturally lead to
the elevation of the priesthood. It is unscientific to assume large
historical events, or large ethnological facts, or the existence of
some creator of social order.<a name="fa16i" id="fa16i" href="#ft16i"><span class="sp">16</span></a></p>

<p>As Benjamin Constant<a name="fa17i" id="fa17i" href="#ft17i"><span class="sp">17</span></a> points out, caste rests on the religious
idea of an indelible stain resting on certain men, and the social
idea of certain functions being committed to certain classes.
The idea of physical purity was largely developed under the
Mosaic legislation; in fact the internal regulations of the
Essenes (who were divided into four classes) resemble the frivolous
prohibitions of Brahmanism. As the daily intercourse of men
in trade and industry presents numberless occasions on which
the stain of real or fancied impurity might be caught, the power
of the religious class who define the rules of purity and the
penalties of their violation becomes very great. Moreover,
the Hindus are deeply religious, and therefore naturally prepared
for Purohiti or priest-rule. They were also passionately attached
to their national hymns, some of which had led them to victory,
while others were associated with the benign influences of nature.
Only the priest could chant or teach these hymns, and it was
believed that the smallest mistake in pronunciation would draw
down the anger of the gods. But however favourable the conditions
of spiritual dominion might be, it seems to have been
by no more natural process than hard fighting that the Brahmans
finally asserted their supremacy. We are told that Parasurama,
the great hero of the Brahmans, &ldquo;cleared the earth thrice seven
times of the Kshatriya caste, and filled with their blood the five
large lakes of Samauta.&rdquo; Wheeler thinks that the substitution
of blood-sacrifices for offerings of parched grain, clarified butter
and <i>soma</i> wine marks an adaptation by the Brahmans of the great
military banquets to the purposes of political supremacy. It
is not, therefore, till the Brahmanic period of Indian history,
which ends with the coming of Sakya Muni, in 600 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, that we
find the caste-definitions of Manu realized as facts. These are&mdash;&ldquo;To
Brahmans he (<i>i.e.</i> Brahma) assigned the duties of reading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page467" id="page467"></a>467</span>
the Vedas, of teaching, of sacrificing, of assisting others to sacrifice,
of giving alms if they be rich, and if indigent of receiving gifts.&rdquo;<a name="fa18i" id="fa18i" href="#ft18i"><span class="sp">18</span></a>
The duties of the Kshatriya are &ldquo;to defend the people, to give
alms, to sacrifice, to read the Veda, to shun the allurements of
sensual gratification.&rdquo; The duties of a Vaisya are &ldquo;to keep
herds of cattle, to bestow largesses, to sacrifice, to read the
scripture, to carry on trade, to lend at interest, and to cultivate
land.&rdquo; These three castes (the twice born) wear the sacred
thread. The one duty of a Sudra is &ldquo;to serve the before-mentioned
classes without depreciating their worth.&rdquo;<a name="fa19i" id="fa19i" href="#ft19i"><span class="sp">19</span></a> The
Brahman is entitled by primogeniture to the whole universe;
he may eat no flesh but that of victims; he has his peculiar
clothes. He is bound to help military and commercial men in
distress. He may seize the goods of a Sudra, and whatever
the latter acquires by labour or succession beyond a certain
amount. The Sudra is to serve the twice born; and even when
emancipated cannot be anything but a Sudra. He may not
learn the Vedas, and in sacrifice he must omit the sacred texts.
A Sudra in distress may turn to a handicraft; and in the same
circumstances a Vaisya may stoop to service. Whatever crime
a Brahman might commit, his person and property were not to
be injured; but whoever struck a Brahman with a blade of grass
would become an inferior quadruped during twenty-one transmigrations.
In the state the Brahman was above all the
ministers; he was the raja&rsquo;s priest, exempt from taxation, the
performer of public sacrifices, the expounder of Manu, and at
one time the physician of bodies as well as of souls. He is more
liable than less holy persons to pollution, and his ablutions are
therefore more frequent. A Kshatriya who slandered a Brahman
was to be fined 100 panas (a copper weight of 200 grains); a
Vaisya was fined 200 panas; a Sudra was to be whipped. A
Brahman slandering any of the lower castes pays 50, 25 or 12
panas. In ordinary salutations a Brahman is asked whether
his devotion has prospered; a Kshatriya, whether he has suffered
from his wounds; a Vaisya whether his health is secure; a
Sudra whether he is in good health.<a name="fa20i" id="fa20i" href="#ft20i"><span class="sp">20</span></a> In administering oaths
a Brahman is asked to swear by his veracity; a Kshatriya by
his weapons, house or elephant; a Vaisya by his kine, grain
or goods; a Sudra by all the most frightful penalties of perjury.
The Hindu mind is fertile in oaths; before the caste assembly
the Dhurm, or caste custom, is sometimes appealed to, or the
feet of Brahma, or some cow or god or sacred river, or the bel
(the sacred creeper), or the roots of the turmeric plant. The
castes are also distinguished by their modes of marriage. Those
peculiar to Brahmans seem to be&mdash;1st, Brahma, when a daughter,
clothed only with a single robe, is given to a man learned in the
Veda whom her father has voluntarily invited and respectfully
receives; 2nd, Devas or Daiva, when a daughter, in gay attire
is given, when the sacrifice is already begun, to the officiating
priest. The primitive marriage forms of Rashasas or Rachasa,
when a maiden is seized by force from home, while she weeps and
calls for help, is said to be appropriate to Kshatriyas. To the
two lower castes the ceremony of Asura is open, in which the
bridegroom, having given as much wealth as he can afford to the
father and paternal kinsman and to the damsel herself, takes her
voluntarily as his bride. A Kshatriya woman on her marriage
with a Brahman must hold an arrow in her hand; a Vaisya
woman marrying one of the sacerdotal or military classes must
hold a whip; a Sudra woman marrying one of the upper castes
must hold the skirt of a mantle.</p>

<p>How little the system described by Manu applies to the existing
castes of India may be seen in these facts&mdash;(1) that there is
no artisan caste mentioned by Manu; (2) that eating with
another caste, or eating food prepared by another caste, is not
said by him to involve loss of caste, though these are now among
the most frequent sources of degradation. The system must
have been profoundly modified by the teaching of Buddha:
&ldquo;As the four rivers which fall into the Ganges lose their names
as soon as they mingle their waters with the holy river, so all
who believe in Buddha cease to be Brahmans, Kshatriyas,
Vaisyas, and Sudras.&rdquo; After Buddha, Sudra dynasties ruled
in many parts of India, and under the Mogul dynasty the Cayets,
a race of Sudras, had almost a monopoly of public offices. But
Buddha did not wish to abolish caste. Thus it is related that a
Brahman Pundit who had embraced the doctrines of Buddha
nevertheless found it necessary, when his king touched him, to
wash from head to foot.<a name="fa21i" id="fa21i" href="#ft21i"><span class="sp">21</span></a> Alexander the Great found no castes
in the Punjab, but Megasthenes had left an account of the ryots
and tradesmen, the military order and the gymnosophists
(including the Buddhist Germanes) whom he found in the country
of the Ganges.<a name="fa22i" id="fa22i" href="#ft22i"><span class="sp">22</span></a> From his use of the word gymnosophist it is
probable that Megasthenes confounded the Brahmans with the
hermits or fakirs; and this explains his statement that any
Hindu might become a Brahman. Megasthenes spent some time
at the court of Sandracottus (Chandragupta Maurya), a contemporary
of Seleucus Nicator. All the later Greeks<a name="fa23i" id="fa23i" href="#ft23i"><span class="sp">23</span></a> follow
his statement and concur in enumerating seven Indian castes&mdash;sophists,
agriculturists, herdsmen, artisans, warriors, inspectors,
councillors. On the revival of Brahmanism it was
found that the second and third castes had disappeared, and
that the field was now occupied by the Brahmans, the Sudras,
and a host of mixed castes, sprung from the original twelve,
Unulum and Prutilum, left-hand and right-hand, which were
formed by the crossing of the four original castes. Manu himself
gives a list of these impure castes, and the Ain-i-Akbari (1556-1605)
makes the positive statement that there were then 500
tribes bearing the name of Kshatriya, while the real caste no
longer existed. Most of these subdivisions are really trade-organizations,
many of them living in village-communities, which
trace descent from a pure caste. Thus in Bengal there are the
Vaidya or Baidya, the physicians, who, Manu says, originated
in the marriage of a Brahman father and a Vaisya mother.</p>

<p>As Colebrooke said, Brahmans and Sudras enter into all trades,
but Brahmans (who are profoundly ignorant even of their own
scriptures) have succeeded in maintaining their monopoly of
Vedic learning, which really means a superficial acquaintance
with the Puranas and Manu. Though they have succeeded in
excluding others from sacred employment, only a portion of the
caste are actually engaged in religious ceremonies, in sacred study,
or even in religious begging. Many are privates in the army,
many water-carriers, many domestic servants. And they have,
like other castes, many subdivisions which prevent intimate
association and intermarriage. The ideal Brahman is gone:
the priest &ldquo;with his hair and beard clipped, his passions subdued,
his mantle white, his body pure, golden rings in his ear.&rdquo;
But the hold which caste has on the Hindu minds may, perhaps,
be most clearly seen in the history of the Christian missions and
in comparatively recent times. The Jesuits Xavier and Fra dei
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page468" id="page468"></a>468</span>
Nobili did everything but become Brahmans in order to convert
the south of India&mdash;they put on a dress of cavy or yellow colour,
they made frequent ablutions, they lived on vegetables and milk,
they put on their foreheads the sandalwood paste used by the
Brahmans&mdash;and Gregory XV. published a bull sanctioning
caste regulations in the Christian churches of India. The
Danish mission of Tranquebar, the German mission of the heroic
Schwarz, whose headquarters were Tanjore, also permitted caste
to be retained by their followers. Even the priests of Buddha,
whose life was a protest against caste, re-erected the system in
the island of Ceylon, where the <i>radis</i> or <i>radias</i> were reduced to
much the same state as the Pariahs.<a name="fa24i" id="fa24i" href="#ft24i"><span class="sp">24</span></a> Protestant missions have
made but little progress, even in recent years. The number
of native converts to Christianity rose from 1,246,000 in 1872
to 2,664,000 in 1901; these figures, however, are by themselves
rather misleading, for Christianity appears to have touched
the higher classes in India not at all, only the out-castes.</p>

<p>It is still the general law that to constitute a good marriage
the parties must belong to the same caste, but to unconnected
families. Undoubtedly, however, the three higher castes were
always permitted to intermarry with the caste next below their
own, the issue taking the lower caste or sometimes forming a new
class. A Sudra need not marry a wife of the same caste or sect
as himself. In 1871 it was decided by the judicial committee
of the privy council that a marriage between a zemindar (land-owner)
of the Malavar class, a subdivision of the Sudra caste,
with a woman of the Vellala class of Sudras is lawful. Generally
also a woman may not marry beneath her own caste. The feeling
is not so strong against a man marrying even in the lowest caste,
for Manu permits the son of a Brahman and a Sudra mother
to raise his family to the highest caste in the seventh generation.
The illegitimacy resulting from an invalid marriage does not
render incapable of caste; at least it does not so disqualify the
lawful children of the bastard. On a forfeiture of caste by either
spouse intercourse ceases between the spouses: if the out-caste
be a sonless woman, she is accounted dead, and funeral rites are
performed for her; if she have a son, he is bound to maintain
her. It is remarkable that the professional concubinage of the
dancing-girl does not involve degradation, if it be with a person
of the same caste. This suggests that whatever may be the
function of caste, it is not a safe guardian of public morality.
The rules as to prohibited degrees in marriage used to be very
strict, but they are now relaxed. An act of 1856 legalized remarriage
by widows in all the castes, with a conditional forfeiture
of the deceased husband&rsquo;s estate, unless the husband has
expressly sanctioned the second marriage. The later Indian
Marriage Act was directed against the iniquitous child marriages;
it requires a <i>minimum</i> age. In many ways the theoretical
inferiority of the Sudra absolves him from the restraints
which the letter of the law lays on the higher castes. Thus a
Sudra may adopt a daughter&rsquo;s or sister&rsquo;s son, though this is
contrary to the general rule that the adopter should be able to
marry the mother of the adopted person. The rule requiring the
person adopted to be of the same caste and <i>gotra</i> or family as the
adopter is also dispensed with in the case of Sudras. In fact, it is
only a married person whom a Sudra may not adopt. As regards
inheritance the Sudra does not come off so well in competition
with the other castes. &ldquo;The sons of a Brahamana in the several
tribes have four shares or three or two or one; the children of
a Kshatriya have three portions or two or one; and those of
a Vaisya take two parts or one.&rdquo; This refers to the case permitted
by law, and not unknown in practice, of a Brahman
having four wives of different castes, a Kshatriya three, and so
on. But all sons of inferior caste are excluded from property
coming by gift to the father; and a Sudra son is also excluded
from land acquired by purchase. It must be recollected, however,
that under an act of 1850, <i>loss</i> of caste no longer affects
the capacity to inherit or to be adopted. In cases of succession
<i>ab intestato</i> on failure of the preceptor, pupil, and fellow-student
(heirs called by the Hindu law after relatives), a priest, or any
Brahman, many succeed. Where a Sudra is the only son of a
Brahman, the Sapinda, or next of kin, would take two-thirds
of the inheritance; where he is the only son of any other twice-born
father, the Sapinda would take one-half. Possibly, the rule
of equal division among sons of equal caste did not at first apply
to Brahmans, who, as the eldest sons of God, would perhaps
observe the custom of primogeniture among themselves. On the
other hand it was laid down in the judicial committee in 1869,
contrary to the collected opinions of the Pundits of the Sudder
court, that, in default of lawful children, the illegitimate children
of the Sudra caste inherit their putative father&rsquo;s estate, and, even
if there be lawful children, are entitled to maintenance out of the
estate. It had previously been decided by Sir Edward Ryan in
1857 that the illegitimate children of a Rajput, or of any other
member of a superior caste, have no right of inheritance even
under will, but a mere right to maintenance, provided the children
are docile. It seems then that the Kshatriya and Vaisya castes,
though in one sense non-existent, still control Hindu succession.</p>

<p>With regard to Persia the <i>Zend Avesta</i> speaks of a fourfold
division of the ancient inhabitants of Iran into priests, warriors,
agriculturists and artificers; and also of a sevenfold division corresponding
to the seven amschespands, or servants of Ormuzd. This
was no invention of Zoroaster, but a tradition from the golden
age of Jemshid or Diemschid. The priestly caste of Magi was
divided into Herbeds or disciples, Mobeds or masters, and Destur
Mobeds or complete masters. The last-named were alone entitled
to read the liturgies of Ormuzd; they alone predicted the future
and carried the sacred <i>costi</i>, or girdle, <i>havan</i>, or cup, and <i>barsom</i>,
or bunch of twigs. The Zend word <i>baresma</i> is supposed to be
connected with Brahma, or sacred element, of which the symbol
was a bunch of kusa grass, generally called veda. The Persian
and Hindu religions are further connected by the ceremony
called Homa in the one and Soma in the other. Haug, in his
<i>Tract on the Origin of Brahmanism</i> (quoted by Muir, <i>ubi supra</i>),
maintains that the division in the <i>Zend Avesta</i> of the followers
of Ahura Mazda into Atharvas, Rathaesvas, and Vastrya was
precisely equivalent to the three superior Indian castes. He
also asserts that only the sons of priests (Atharvas) could become
priests, a rule still in force among the Parsis. The Book of Daniel
rather suggests that the Magi were an elective body; and as
regards the secular classes there does not seem to be a trace of
hereditary employment or religious subordination. There is
a legend in the Dabistan of a great conqueror, Mahabad, who
divided the Abyssinians into the usual four castes; and Strabo
mentions a similar classification of the Iberians into kings, priests,
soldiers, husbandmen and menials.</p>

<p>At one time it was the universal opinion that in Egypt there
were at least two great castes, priests and warriors, the functions
of which were transmitted from father to son, the minor professions
grouped under the great castes being also subject to
hereditary transmission. This opinion was held by Otfried
Müller,<a name="fa25i" id="fa25i" href="#ft25i"><span class="sp">25</span></a> Meiners of Göttingen, and others. Doubts were first
suggested by Rossellini, and after Champollion had deciphered
the hieroglyphic inscriptions, J.J. Ampère<a name="fa26i" id="fa26i" href="#ft26i"><span class="sp">26</span></a> boldly announced
that there were in Egypt no castes strictly so called; that in
particular the professions of priest, soldier, judge, &amp;c., were not
hereditary; and that the division of Egyptian society was merely
that which is generally found in certain stages of social growth
between the liberal professions and the mechanical arts and
trades. No difference of colour, or indeed of any feature, has been
observed in the monumental pictures of the different Egyptian
castes. From an inspection of numerous tombs, sarcophagi,
and funeral stones, which frequently enumerate the names and
professions of several kinsfolk of the deceased, Ampère concluded
that sacerdotal and military functions were sometimes united
in the same person, and might even be combined with civil
functions; that intermarriage might certainly take place between
the sacred and military orders; and that the members of the
same natural family did frequently adopt the different occupations
which had been supposed to be the exclusive property of the
castes. The tombs of Beni Hassan show in a striking manner the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page469" id="page469"></a>469</span>
Egyptian tendency to accumulate, rather than to separate,
employments. Occasionally families were set apart for the
worship of a particular divinity. An interesting &ldquo;section&rdquo; of
Egyptian society is afforded by a granite monument preserved
in the museum at Naples. Nine figures in bas-relief represent
the deceased, his father, three brothers, a paternal uncle, and the
father and two brothers of his wife. Another side contains the
mother, wife, wife&rsquo;s mother and maternal aunts. The deceased
is described as a military officer and superintendent of buildings;
his elder brother as a priest and architect; his third brother as a
provincial governor, and his father as a priest of Ammon. The
family of the wife is exclusively sacerdotal. Egyptian caste,
therefore, permitted two brothers to be of different castes,
and one person to be of more castes than one, and of different
castes from those to which his father or wife belonged. The lower
employments, commerce, agriculture, even medicine, are never
mentioned on the tombs. The absolute statements about caste
in Egypt, circulated by such writers as Reynier and De Goguet,
have, no doubt, been founded on passages in Herodotus (ii. 143,
164), who mentions seven classes, and makes war an hereditary
profession; in Diodorus Siculus (i. 2-8), who mentions five
classes and a hereditary priesthood; and in Plato, who, anxious
to illustrate the principle of compulsory division of labour, on
which his republic was based, speaks in the <i>Timaeus</i> of a total
separation of the six classes&mdash;priests, soldiers, husbandmen,
artisans, hunters and shepherds. Heeren (ii. 594) does not
hesitate to ascribe the formation of Egyptian caste to the meeting
of different races. According to the chronology constructed
by Bunsen the division into castes began in the period 10,000-9000,
and was completed along with the introduction of animal
worship and the improvement of writing under the third dynasty
in the 6th or 7th century of the Old Empire. The Scholiast of
Apollonius Rhodius, on the authority of Dicaearchus, in the
Second Book of <i>Hellas</i>, mentions a king, Sesonchosis, who, about
3712 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, &ldquo;enacted that no one should abandon his father&rsquo;s
trade, for this he considered as leading to avarice.&rdquo; Bunsen
conjectures that this may refer to Sesostoris, the lawgiver of
Manetho&rsquo;s third or Memphite dynasty, the eighth from Menes,
who introduced writing, building with hewn stone, and medicine;
possibly, also, to Sesostris, who, Aristotle says (<i>Polit.</i> vii. 1),
introduced caste to Crete. He further observes that in Egypt
there was never a conquered indigenous race. There was one
nation with one language and one religion; the public panegyrics
embraced the whole people; every Egyptian was the child and
friend of the gods. The kings were generally warriors, and latterly
adopted into the sacerdotal caste. Intermarriage was the rule,
except between the swineherds and all other classes. &ldquo;Every
shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians&rdquo; (Gen. xlvi. 34).</p>

custom of <i>myestnichestvo</i>, by which no one entering the public service

military or civil, above a certain rank, and a family remaining out of
office for two generations lost its rights of nobility; but in 1854 the
privilege was confined to army colonels and state councillors of the
4th class. At one time, therefore, the <i>razryadniya knighi</i>, or special
registers, superseded by Peter the Great&rsquo;s <i>barkhatnaya kniga</i>, or
Velvet Book, contained a complete code of social privilege and precedence.
Peter&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>tabel o rangakh</i>&rdquo; contained fourteen classes. The

us to its other aspects. There is no doubt that it is the main cause
of the fundamental stability and contentment by which Indian
society has been braced up for centuries against the shocks of
politics and the cataclysms of Nature. It provides every man with
his place, his career, his occupation, his circle of friends. It makes
him, at the outset, a member of a corporate body: it protects him
through life from the canker of social jealousy and unfulfilled
aspirations; it ensures him companionship and a sense of community
with others in like case with himself. The caste organization
is to the Hindu his club, his trade union, his benefit society, his
philanthropic society. An Indian without caste, as things stand at
present, is not quite easy to imagine.&rdquo; (Sidney Low, <i>Vision of India</i>,

<p><a name="ft12i" id="ft12i" href="#fa12i"><span class="fn">12</span></a> The idea of a conquering white race is strangely repeated in the
later history of India. The Rajputs and Brahmans are succeeded by
the Mussulmans, the Turks, the Afghans. There was an aristocracy
of colour under the Mogul dynasty. But under an Indian climate it
could not last many generations. The Brahmans of southern India
were as black as the lowest castes; the Chandalas are said to be
descended from Brahmans. According to Manu the Chandala must
not dwell within town; his sole wealth must be dogs and asses; his
clothes must consist of the mantles of deceased persons; his dishes
must be broken pots. Surely this vituperative description must
apply to an aboriginal race.</p>

of functions under the rule of a sacerdotal class as a necessary and
universal stage of social progress, greatly modified by war and
colonization. The morality of caste was, he contends, an improvement
on what preceded; but its permanence was impossible, because
&ldquo;the political rule of intelligence is hostile to human progress.&rdquo;
The seclusion of women and the preservation of industrial inventions
were features of caste; and the higher priests were also magistrates,
philosophers, artists, engineers, and physicians.</p>

<p><a name="ft18i" id="ft18i" href="#fa18i"><span class="fn">18</span></a> The great mass of the Brahmans were in reality mendicants, who
lived on the festivals of birth, marriage, and death, and on the fines
exacted for infractions of caste rule. Others had establishments
called Muths, endowed with Jagir villages. There were two distinct
orders of officiating priests&mdash;the Purohita, or family priest, who
performed all the domestic rites, and probably gave advice in secular
matters, and the Guru, who is the head of a religious sect, making
tours of superintendence and exaction, and having the power to
degrade from caste and to restore. In some cases the Guru is recognized
as the Mehitra or officer of the caste assembly, from whom he
receives Huks, or salary, and an exemption from house and stamp
taxes, and service as begarree (Steele&rsquo;s <i>Law and Customs of Hindoo
Castes within the Dekhan Provinces</i>, 1826; later edition, 1868).
Expulsion from caste follows on a number of moral offences (<i>e.g.</i>
assault, murder, &amp;c.), as well as ceremonial offences (<i>e.g.</i> eating
prohibited food, eating with persons of lower caste, abstaining from
funeral rites, having connexion with a low-caste woman). Exclusion
means that it is not allowed to eat with or enter the houses of the
members of the caste, the offender being in theory not degraded but
dead. For some heinous offences, <i>i.e.</i> against the express letter of
the Shasters, no readmission is possible. But generally this depends
on the ability of the out-caste to pay a fine, and to supply the caste
with an expiatory feast of sweetmeats. He has also to go through
the Sashtanyam, or prostration of eight members, and to drink the
Panchakaryam, <i>i.e.</i> drink of the five products of the cow (<i>Description

<p><span class="bold">CASTEL, LOUIS BERTRAND<a name="ar179" id="ar179"></a></span> (1688-1757), French mathematician,
was born at Montpellier on the 11th of November
1688, and entered the order of the Jesuits in 1703. Having
studied literature, he afterwards devoted himself entirely to
mathematics and natural philosophy. He wrote several scientific
works, that which attracted most attention at the time
being his <i>Optique des couleurs</i> (1740), or treatise on the melody
of colours. He endeavoured to illustrate the subject by a
<i>clavecin oculaire</i>, or ocular harpsichord; but the treatise and
the illustration were quickly forgotten. He also wrote <i>Mathématique
universelle</i> (1728) and <i>Traité de physique sur la pesanteur
universelle des corps</i> (1724). He also published a critical account
of the system of Sir Isaac Newton in French in 1743.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASTELAR Y RIPOLL, EMILIO<a name="ar180" id="ar180"></a></span> (1832-1899), Spanish statesman,
was born at Cadiz on the 8th of September 1832. At the
age of seven he lost his father, who had taken an active part in
the progressist agitations during the reign of Ferdinand VII.,
and had passed several years as an exile in England. He attended
a grammar-school at Sax. In 1848 he began to study
law in Madrid, but soon elected to compete for admittance at
the school of philosophy and letters, where he took the degree
of doctor in 1853. He was an obscure republican student when
the Spanish revolutionary movement of 1854 took place, and the
young liberals and democrats of that epoch decided to hold a
meeting in the largest theatre of the capital. On that occasion
Castelar delivered his maiden speech, which at once placed him
in the van of the advanced politicians of the reign of Queen
Isabella. From that moment he took an active part in politics,
radical journalism, literary and historical pursuits. Castelar
was compromised in the first rising of June 1866, which was
concerted by Marshal Prim, and crushed, after much bloodshed,
in the streets by Marshals O&rsquo;Donnell and Serrano. A court-martial
condemned him <i>in contumaciam</i> to death by &ldquo;garote
vil,&rdquo; and he had to hide in the house of a friend until he escaped
to France. There he lived two years until the successful revolution
of 1868 allowed him to return and enter the Cortes for the
first time&mdash;as deputy for Saragossa. At the same time he resumed
the professorship of history at the Madrid university.
Castelar soon became famous by his rhetorical speeches in the
Constituent Cortes of 1869, where he led the republican minority
in advocating a federal republic as the logical outcome of the
recent revolution. He thus gave much trouble to men like
Serrano, Topete and Prim, who had never harboured the idea
of drifting into advanced democracy, and who had each his own
scheme for re-establishing the monarchy with certain constitutional
restrictions. Hence arose Castelar&rsquo;s constant and
vigorous criticisms of the successive plans mooted to place a
Hohenzollern, a Portuguese, the duke of Montpensier, Espartero
and finally Amadeus of Savoy on the throne. He attacked with
relentless vigour the short-lived monarchy of Amadeus, and contributed
to its downfall.</p>

<p>The abdication of Amadeus led to the proclamation of the
federal republic. The senate and congress, very largely composed
of monarchists, permitted themselves to be dragged along into
democracy by the republican minority headed by Salmeron,
Figueras, Pi y Margall and Castelar. The short-lived federal
republic from the 11th of February 1873 to the 3rd of January
1874 was the culminating point of the career of Castelar, and his
conduct during those eleven months was much praised by the
wiser portion of his fellow-countrymen, though it alienated from
him the sympathies of the majority of his quondam friends in
the republican ranks.</p>

<p>Before the revolution of 1868, Castelar had begun to dissent
from the doctrines of the more advanced republicans, and
particularly as to the means to be employed for their success.
He abhorred bloodshed, he disliked mob rule, he did not approve
of military <i>pronunciamientos</i>. His idea would have been a
parliamentary republic on the American lines, with some traits
of the Swiss constitution to keep in touch with the regionalist
and provincialist inclinations of many parts of the peninsula.
He would have placed at the head of his commonwealth a
president and Cortes freely elected by the people, ruling the
country in a liberal spirit and with due respect for conservative
principles, religious traditions and national unity. Such a
statesman was sure to clash with the doctrinaires, like Salmeron,
who wanted to imitate French methods; with Pi y Margall,
who wanted a federal republic after purely Spanish ideas of
decentralization; and above all with the intransigent and gloomy
fanatics who became the leaders of the cantonal insurrections at
Cadiz, Seville, Valencia, Malaga and Cartagena in 1873.</p>

<p>At first Castelar did his best to work with the other republican
members of the first government of the federal republic. He
accepted the post of minister for foreign affairs. He even went
so far as to side with his colleagues, when serious difficulties
arose between the new government and the president of the
Cortes, Señor Martos, who was backed by a very imposing
commission composed of the most influential conservative
members of the last parliament of the Savoyard king, which had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page470" id="page470"></a>470</span>
suspended its sittings shortly after proclaiming the federal
republic. A sharp struggle was carried on for weeks between
the executive and this commission, at first presided over by
Martos, and, when he resigned, by Salmeron. In the background
Marshal Serrano and many politicians and military men steadily
advocated a <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> in order to avert the triumph of the
republicans. The adversaries of the executive were prompted
by the captain-general of Madrid, Pavia, who promised the
co-operation of the garrison of the capital. The president,
Salmeron, and Marshal Serrano himself lacked decision at the
last moment, and lost time and many opportunities by which
the republican ministers profited. The federal republicans
became masters of the situation in the last fortnight of April
1873, and turned the tables on their adversaries by making a
pacific bloodless <i>pronunciamiento</i>.</p>

<p>The battalions of the militia that had assembled in the bull-ring
near Marshal Serrano&rsquo;s house to assist the anti-democratic
movement were disarmed, and their leaders, the politicians
and generals, were allowed to escape to France or Portugal.
The Cortes were dissolved, and the federal and constituent
Cortes of the republic convened, but they only sat during the
summer of 1873, long enough to show their absolute incapacity,
and to convince the executive that the safest policy was to
suspend the session for several months.</p>

<p>This was the darkest period of the annals of the Spanish
revolution of 1873-1874. Matters got to such a climax of disorder,
disturbance and confusion, from the highest to the lowest strata
of Spanish society, that the president of the executive, Figueras,
deserted his post and fled the country. Pi y Margall and Salmeron,
in successive attempts to govern, found no support in
the really important and influential elements of Spanish society.
Salmeron had even to appeal to such well-known reactionary
generals as Pavia, Sanchez, Bregna and Moriones, to assume
the command of the armies in the south and in the north of
Spain. Fortunately these officers responded to the call of the
executive. In less than five weeks a few thousand men properly
handled sufficed to quell the cantonal risings in Cordoba, Sevilla,
Cadiz and Malaga, and the whole of the south might have been
soon pacified, if the federal republican ministers had not once
more given way to the pressure of the majority of the Cortes,
composed of &ldquo;Intransigentes&rdquo; and radical republicans. The
president, Salmeron, after showing much indecision, resigned,
but not until he had recalled the general in command in Andalusia,
Pavia. This resignation was not an unfortunate event for the
country, as the federal Cortes not only made Castelar chief of
the executive, though his partisans were in a minority in the
Parliament, but they gave him much liberty to act, as they
decided to suspend the sittings of the house until 2nd January
1874. This was the turning-point of the Spanish revolution,
as from that day the tide set in towards the successive developments
that led to the restoration of the Bourbons.</p>

<p>On becoming the ruler of Spain at the beginning of September
1873, Castelar at once devoted his attention to the reorganization
of the army, whose numbers had dwindled down to about
70,000 men. This force, though aided by considerable bodies
of local militia and volunteers in the northern and western
provinces, was insufficient to cope with the 60,000 Carlists in
arms, and with the still formidable nucleus of cantonalists around
Alcoy and Cartagena. To supply the deficiencies Castelar called
out more than 100,000 conscripts, who joined the colours in less
than six weeks. He selected his generals without respect of
politics, sending Moriones to the Basque provinces and Navarre
at the head of 20,000 men, Martinez Campos to Catalonia with
several thousand, and Lopez Dominguez, the nephew of Marshal
Serrano, to begin the land blockade of the last stronghold of the
cantonal insurgents, Cartagena, where the crews of Spain&rsquo;s only
fleet had joined the revolt.</p>

<p>Castelar next turned his attention to the Church. He renewed
direct relations with the Vatican, and at last induced Pope
Pius IX. to approve his selection of two dignitaries to occupy
vacant sees as well as his nominee for the vacant archbishopric
of Valencia, a prelate who afterwards became archbishop of
Toledo, and remained to the end a close friend of Castelar.
He put a stop to all persecutions of the Church and religious
orders, and enforced respect of Church property. He attempted
to restore some order in the treasury and administration of
finance, with a view to obtain ways and means to cover the
expense of the three civil wars, Carlist, cantonal and Cuban.
The Cuban insurgents gave him much trouble and anxiety, the
famous <i>Virginius</i> incident nearly leading to a rupture between
Spain and the United States. Castelar sent out to Cuba all the
reinforcements he could spare, and a new governor-general,
Jovellar, whom he peremptorily instructed to crush the mutinous
spirit of the Cuban militia, and not allow them to drag Spain
into a conflict with the United States. Acting upon the instructions
of Castelar, Jovellar gave up the filibuster vessels, and those
of the crew and passengers who had not been summarily shot
by General Burriel. Castelar always prided himself on having
terminated this incident without too much damage to the prestige
of Spain.</p>

<p>At the end of 1873 Castelar had reason to be satisfied with
the results of his efforts, with the military operations in the
peninsula, with the assistance he was getting from the middle
classes and even from many of the political elements of the
Spanish revolution that were not republican. On the other
hand, on the eve of the meeting of the federal Cortes, he could
indulge in no illusions as to what he had to expect from the bulk
of the republicans, who openly dissented from his conservative
and conciliatory policy, and announced that they would reverse
it on the very day the Cortes met. Warnings came in plenty, and
no less a personage than the man he had made captain-general of
Madrid, General Pavia, suggested that, if a conflict arose between
Castelar and the majority of the Cortes, not only the garrison
of Madrid and its chief, but all the armies in the field and their
generals, were disposed to stand by the president. Castelar knew
too well what such offers meant in the classic land of <i>pronunciamientos</i>,
and he refused so flatly that Pavia did not renew his
advice. The sequel is soon told. The Cortes met on the 2nd
of January 1874. The intransigent majority refused to listen to
a last eloquent appeal that Castelar made to their patriotism
and common sense, and they passed a vote of censure. Castelar
resigned. The Cortes went on wrangling for a day and night
until, at daybreak on the 3rd of January 1874, General Pavia
forcibly ejected the deputies, closed and dissolved the Cortes,
and called up Marshal Serrano to form a provisional government.</p>

<p>Castelar kept apart from active politics during the twelve
months that Serrano acted as president of the republic. Another
<i>pronunciamiento</i> finally put an end to it in the last week of
December 1874, when Generals Campos at Sagunto, Jovellar
at Valencia, Primo de Rivera at Madrid, and Laserna at Logroño,
proclaimed Alphonso XII. king of Spain. Castelar then went
into voluntary exile for fifteen months, at the end of which
he was elected deputy for Barcelona. He sat in all subsequent
parliaments, and just a month before his death he was elected
as representative of Murcia. During that period he became
even more estranged from the majority of the republicans.
Bitter experience had shown him that their federal doctrines
and revolutionary methods could lead to nothing in harmony
with the aspirations of the majority of Spaniards. He elected,
to use his own words, to defend and to seek the realization of
the substance of the programme of the Spanish revolution of
1868 by evolution, and legal, pacific means. Hence the contrast
between his attitude from 1876 to 1886, during the reign of
Alphonso XII., when he stood in the front rank of the Opposition
to defend the reforms of that revolution against Señor Canovas,
and his attitude from 1886 to 1891. In this latter period Castelar
acted as a sort of independent auxiliary of Sagasta and of the
Liberal party. As soon as Castelar saw universal suffrage re-established
he solemnly declared in the Cortes that his task
was accomplished, his political mission at an end, and that he
proposed to devote the remainder of his life to those literary,
historical, philosophical, and economic studies which he had
never neglected even in the busiest days of his political
career. Indeed, it was his extraordinary activity and power of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page471" id="page471"></a>471</span>
assimilation in such directions that allowed him to keep his
fellow-countrymen so well informed of what was going on in
the outer world. His literary and journalistic labours occupied
much of his time, and were his chief means of subsistence.
He left unfinished a history of Europe in the 19th century.
The most conspicuous of his earlier works were:&mdash;<i>A History of
Civilization in the First Five Centuries of Christianity</i>, <i>Recollections
of Italy</i>, <i>Life of Lord Byron</i>, <i>The History of the Republican
Movement in Europe</i>, <i>The Redemption of Slaves</i>, <i>The Religious
Revolution</i>, <i>Historical Essays on the Middle Ages</i>, <i>The Eastern
Question</i>, <i>Fra Filippo Lippi</i>, <i>History of the Discovery of America</i>,
and some historical novels. Castelar died near Murcia on the
25th of May 1899, at the age of 66. His funeral at Madrid was
an imposing demonstration of the sympathy and respect of all
classes and parties.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASTELL, EDMUND<a name="ar183" id="ar183"></a></span> (1606-1685), English orientalist, was
born in 1606 at Tadlow, in Cambridgeshire. At the age of fifteen
he entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, but afterwards changed
his residence to St John&rsquo;s, on account of the valuable library
there. His great work was the compiling of his <i>Lexicon Heptaglotton
Hebraicum, Chaldaicum, Syriacum, Samaritanum, Aethiopicum,
Arabicum, et Persicum</i> (1669). Over this book he spent
eighteen years, working (if we may accept his own statement)
from sixteen to eighteen hours a day; he employed fourteen
assistants, and by an expenditure of £12,000 brought himself
to poverty, for his lexicon, though full of the most unusual
learning, did not find purchasers. He was actually in prison
in 1667 because he was unable to discharge his brother&rsquo;s debts,
for which he had made himself liable. A volume of poems
dedicated to the king brought him preferment. He was made
prebendary of Canterbury and professor of Arabic at Cambridge.
Before undertaking the <i>Lexicon Heptaglotton</i>, Castell had helped
Dr Brian Walton in the preparation of his Polyglott Bible. His
MSS. he bequeathed to the university of Cambridge. He died
in 1685 at Higham Gobion, Bedfordshire, where he was rector.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The Syriac section of the <i>Lexicon</i> was issued separately at Göttingen
in 1788 by J.D. Michaelis, who offers a tribute to Castell&rsquo;s

<p><span class="bold">CASTELLAMMARE DI STABIA<a name="ar184" id="ar184"></a></span> (anc. <i>Stabiae</i>), a seaport and
episcopal see of Campania, Italy, in the province of Naples,
17 m. S.E. by rail from the town of Naples. Pop. (1901) town,
26,378; commune, 32,589. It lies in the south-east angle of
the Bay of Naples, at the beginning of the peninsula of Sorrento,
and owing to the sea and mineral water baths (12 different
springs) and its attractive situation, with a splendid view of
Vesuvius and fine woods on the hills behind, it is a favourite
resort of foreigners in spring and autumn and of Neapolitans
in summer. The castle from which it takes its name, on the
hill to the south of the town, was built by the emperor Frederick
II. There are three large churches of the late 18th century.
There are a large royal dockyard and a small-arms factory;
there are also iron works, cotton, flour and macaroni mills. The
value of imports (chiefly coal, wheat, scrap-iron and cheese)
for 1904 was £1,239,048, and the value of exports (chiefly
macaroni and green fruit) £769,100. There is also a sponge
trade, but the former coral trade is depressed. The port was
cleared by 420 vessels of 477,713 tonnage in 1905. An electric
tramway along the coast road to Sorrento was opened in 1905.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASTELLESI, ADRIANO<a name="ar185" id="ar185"></a></span> (c. 1460?-c. 1521?), known also
as <span class="sc">Corneto</span> from his birthplace, Italian cardinal and writer,
was sent by Innocent VIII. to reconcile James III. of Scotland
with his subjects. While in England he was appointed (1503),
by Henry VII., to the see of Hereford, and in the following
year to the more lucrative diocese of Bath and Wells, but he
never resided in either. Returning to Rome, he became secretary
to Alexander VI. and was made by him cardinal (May 31,
1503). A man of doubtful reputation, Alexander&rsquo;s confidant and
favourite, he paid the pope a large sum for his elevation. He
bought a <i>vigna</i> in the Borgo near the Vatican, and thereon
erected a sumptuous palace after designs by Bramante; and it
was here, in the summer of 1503, that he entertained the pope
and Cesare Borgia at a banquet that went on till nightfall despite
the unhealthy season of the year, when ague in its most malignant
form was rife. Of the three, Cardinal Adrian was the first to
fall ill, the pope succumbing a week after. The story of the
poisoning of the pope is to be relegated to the realm of fiction.
Soon after the election of Leo X. the cardinal was implicated
in the conspiracy of Cardinal Petrucci against the pope, and
confessed his guilt; but, pardon being offered only on condition
of the payment o£ 25,000 ducats, he fled from Rome and was
subsequently deposed from the cardinalate. As early as 1504
he had presented his palace (now the Palazzo Giraud-Torlonia)
to Henry VII. as a residence for the English ambassador to the
Holy See; and on his flight Henry VIII., who had quarrelled
with him, gave it to Cardinal Campeggio. Adrian first fled to
Venice. Of his subsequent history nothing is known for certain.
It is said that he was murdered by a servant when on his way
to the conclave that elected Adrian VI. As a writer, he was one
of the first to restore the Latin tongue to its pristine purity;
and among his works are <i>De Vera Philosophia ex quatuor doctoribus
ecclesiae</i> (Bologna, 1507), <i>De Sermone Latino</i> (Basel, 1513),
and a poem, <i>De Venatione</i> (Venice, 1534).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASTELLI, IGNAZ FRANZ<a name="ar186" id="ar186"></a></span> (1781-1862), Austrian dramatist,
was born at Vienna on the 6th of March 1781. He studied law
at the university, and then entered the government service.
During the Napoleonic invasions his patriotism inspired him to
write stirring war songs, one of which, <i>Kriegslied für die österreichische
Armee</i>, was printed by order of the archduke Charles
and distributed in thousands. For this Castelli was proclaimed
by Napoleon in the <i>Moniteur</i>, and had to seek refuge in Hungary.
In 1815 he accompanied the allies into France as secretary to
Count Cavriani, and, after his return to Vienna, resumed his
official post in connexion with the estates of Lower Austria.
In 1842 he retired to his property at Lilienfeld, where, surrounded
by his notable collections of pictures and other art
treasures, he for the rest of his life devoted himself to literature.
Castelli&rsquo;s dramatic talent was characteristically Austrian; his
plays were well constructed and effective and satirized unsparingly
the foibles of the Viennese. But his wit was too local
and ephemeral to appeal to any but his own generation, and if
he is remembered at all to-day it is by his excellent <i>Gedichte
in niederösterreichischer Mundart</i> (1828). He died at Lilienfeld
on the 5th of February 1862.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Castelli&rsquo;s <i>Gesammelte Gedichte</i> appeared in 1835 in 6 vols.; a
selection of his <i>Werke</i> in 1843 in 15 vols. (2nd ed., 1848), followed
by 6 supplementary volumes in 1858. His autobiography, <i>Memoiren
meines Lebens</i>, appeared in 1861-1862 in 4 vols.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASTELLO, BERNARDO<a name="ar187" id="ar187"></a></span> (1557-1629), Genoese portrait and
historical painter, born at Albaro near Genoa, was the intimate
friend of Tasso, and took upon himself the task of designing
the figures of the <i>Gerusalemme Liberata</i>, published in 1592;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page472" id="page472"></a>472</span>
some of these subjects were engraved by Agostino Caracci.
Besides painting a number of works in Genoa, mostly in a rapid
and superficial style, Castello was employed in Rome and in
the court of the duke of Savoy.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASTELLO, GIOVANNI BATTISTA<a name="ar188" id="ar188"></a></span> (1500?-1569?), Italian
historical painter, was born near Bergamo in 1500 or perhaps
1509, and is hence ordinarily termed Il Bergamasco. He belongs,
however, to the school of Genoa, but does not appear to have
had any family relationship with the other two painters named
Castello, also noticed here. He was employed to decorate the
Nunziata di Portoria in Genoa, the saloon of the Lanzi Palace
at Gorlago, and the Pardo Palace in Spain. His best-known
works are the &ldquo;Martyrdom of St Sebastian,&rdquo; and the picture
of &ldquo;Christ as Judge of the World&rdquo; on one of the vaultings of
the Annunziata. He was an architect and sculptor as well as
painter. In 1567 he was invited to Madrid by Philip II., and
there he died, holding the office of architect of the royal palaces.
The date of death (as of birth) is differently stated as 1569 or
1579.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASTELLO, VALERIO<a name="ar189" id="ar189"></a></span> (1625-1659), Italian painter, was the
youngest son of Bernardo Castello (<i>q.v.</i>). He surpassed his father,
and particularly excelled in painting battle-scenes. He painted
the &ldquo;Rape of the Sabines,&rdquo; now in the Palazzo Brignole, Genoa,
and decorated the cupola of the church of the Annunziata in the
same city. In these works he is regarded by his admirers as
combining the fire of Tintoretto with the general style of Paolo
Veronese.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASTELLO BRANCO, CAMILLO,<a name="ar190" id="ar190"></a></span> <span class="sc">Visconde de Correia
Botelho</span> (1825-1890), Portuguese novelist, was born out of
wedlock and lost his parents in infancy. He spent his early years
in a village in Traz-os-Montes. He learnt to love poetry from
Camoens and Bocage, while Mendes Pinto gave him a lust for
adventure, but he dreamed more than he read, and grew up
undisciplined and proud. He studied in Oporto and Coimbra
with much irregularity, and since his disdain for the intrigues
and miseries of politics in Portugal debarred him from the chance
of a government post, he entered the career of letters to gain
a livelihood. After a spell of journalistic work in Oporto and
Lisbon he proceeded to the Episcopal seminary in the former
city with a view of studying for the priesthood, and during this
period wrote a number of religious works and translated Chateaubriand.
He actually took minor orders, but his restless nature
prevented him from following one course for long and he soon
returned to the world, and henceforth kept up a feverish literary
activity to the end. He was created a viscount in 1885 in
recognition of his services to letters, and when his health finally
broke down and he could no longer use his pen, parliament gave
him a pension for life. When, having lost his sight, and suffering
from chronic nervous disease, he died by his own hand in 1890,
it was generally recognized that Portugal had lost the most
national of her modern writers.</p>

<p>Apart from his plays and verses, Castello Branco&rsquo;s works may
be divided into three sections. The first comprises his romances
of the imagination, of which <i>Os mysterios de Lisboa</i>, in the style
of Victor Hugo, is a fair example. The second includes his novels
of manners, a style of which he was the creator and remained
the chief exponent until the appearance of <i>O Crime de Padre
Amaro</i> of Eça de Queiroz. In these he is partly idealist and
partly realist, and describes to perfection the domestic and social
life of Portugal in the early part of the 19th century. The third
division embraces his writings in the domain of history, biography
and literary criticism. Among these may be cited
<i>Noites de Lamego</i>, <i>Cousas leves e pesadas</i>, <i>Cavar em ruinas</i>,
<i>Memorias do Bispo do Grão Para</i> and <i>Bohemia do Espirito</i>.</p>

<p>In all, his publications number about two hundred and sixty,
belonging to many departments of letters, but he owes his great
and lasting reputation to his romances. Notwithstanding the
fact that his slender means obliged him to produce very rapidly
to the order of publishers, who only paid him from £30 to £60
a book, he never lost his individuality under the pressure.
Knowing the life of the people by experience and not from
books, he was able to fix in his pages a succession of strongly
marked and national types, such as the <i>brazileiro</i>, the old <i>fidalgo</i>
of the north, and the Minho priest, while his lack of personal
acquaintance with foreign countries and his relative ignorance
of their literatures preserved him from the temptation, so dangerous
to a Portuguese, of imitating the classical writers of the
larger nations. Among the most notable of his romances are
<i>O Romance de un Homem Rico</i>, his favourite, <i>Retrato de Ricardina,
Amor de Perdição</i>, and the magnificent series entitled <i>Novellas
do Minho</i>. Many of his novels are autobiographical, like <i>Onde
está a felicidade</i>, <i>Memorias do Carcere</i> and <i>Vingança</i>. Castello
Branco is an admirable story-teller, largely because he was a
brilliant improvisatore, but he does not attempt character
study. Nothing can exceed the richness of his vocabulary, and
no other Portuguese author has shown so profound a knowledge
of the popular language. Though nature had endowed him with
the poetic temperament, his verses are mediocre, but his best
plays are cast in bold lines and contain really dramatic situations,
while his comedies are a triumph of the grotesque, with a mordant
vein running through them that recalls Gil Vicente.</p>

<p>The collected works of Camillo Castello Branco are published by
the Companhia Editora of Lisbon, and his most esteemed books

<p><span class="bold">CASTELLO BRANCO,<a name="ar191" id="ar191"></a></span> an episcopal city and the capital of an
administrative district formerly included in the province of
Beira, Portugal; 1560 ft. above the sea, on the Abrantes-Guarda
railway. Pop. (1900) 7288. Numerous Roman remains bear
witness to the antiquity of Castello Branco, but its original name
is unknown. The city is dominated by a ruined castle, and
partly enclosed by ancient walls; its chief buildings are the
cathedral and episcopal palace. Cloth is manufactured, and there
is a flourishing local trade in cork, wine and olive oil. The
administrative district of Castello Branco, which comprises the
valleys of the Zezere, Ocreza and Ponsul, right-hand tributaries
of the Tagus, coincides with the south-eastern part of Beira;

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASTELLÓN DE LA PLANA,<a name="ar192" id="ar192"></a></span> a maritime province of eastern
Spain, formed in 1833 of districts formerly included in Valencia,
and bounded on the N. by Teruel and Tarragona, E. by the
Mediterranean Sea, S. by Valencia, and W. by Teruel. Pop.
(1900) 310,828; area, 2495 sq. m. The surface of the province
is almost everywhere mountainous, and flat only near the coast
and along some of the river valleys. Even on the coast the
Atalayas de Alcalá and the Desierto de las Palmas form two
well-defined though not lofty ridges. The Mijares or Millares
is the principal river, flowing east-south-east from the highlands
of Teruel, between the Sierras of Espina and Espadan towards
the south, and the peak called Peña Golosa (5945 ft.) towards
the north, until it reaches the sea a little south of the capital,
also called Castellón de la Plana. The Monlleo, a left-hand
tributary of the Mijares; the Bergantes, which flows inland to
join the Guadalope in Teruel; the Cenia, which divides Castellón
from Tarragona; and a variety of lesser streams, render the
province abundantly fertile. No considerable inlet breaks the
regularity of the coast-line, and there is no first-class harbour.
The climate is cold and variable in the hilly districts, temperate
in winter and very warm in summer in the lowlands. Agriculture,
fruit-growing, and especially the cultivation of the vine
and olive, employ the majority of the peasantry; stock-farming
and sea-fishing are also of importance. Lead, zinc, iron and
other ores have been discovered in the province; but in 1903,
out of 129 mining concessions registered, only two were worked,
and their output, lead and zinc, was quite insignificant. The
local industries are mainly connected with fish-curing, paper,
porcelain, woollens, cotton, silk, esparto, brandy and oils.
Wine, oranges and oil are exported to foreign countries and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page473" id="page473"></a>473</span>
other parts of Spain. The important Barcelona-Valencia
railway skirts the coast, passing through the capital; and the
Calatayúd-Sagunto line crosses the southern extremity of the
province. Elsewhere the roads, which are generally indifferent,
form the sole means of communication. Castellón (29,904),
Villarreal (16,068), the port of Burriana (12,962), and Peñiscola
(3142), a town of some historical interest, are described in
separate articles. The other chief towns are Alcalá de Chisbert
(6293), Almazora (7076), Benicarló (7251), Maella (7335), Onda
(6595), Segorbe (7045), Vail de Uxó (8643), Villafamés (6708)

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASTELLÓN DE LA PLANA,<a name="ar193" id="ar193"></a></span> the capital of the province
described above, on the Barcelona-Valencia railway, 4 m. from
the Mediterranean Sea. Pop. (1900) 29,904. The broad and
fertile plain in which Castellón is built is watered artificially by
a Moorish aqueduct, largely cut through the solid rock, and
supplied by the estuary of the Mijares, 5 m. south-east. The
town is partly encircled by ancient walls; and, although most
of its public buildings are modern, it contains several convents
of early foundation, a curious old bell-tower, 150 ft. high, and a
parish church chiefly noteworthy for a painting in the interior
by Francisco Ribalta, who was born here in the middle of the
16th century. Castellón has a brisk trade, its manufactures
comprising porcelain, leather, silk, linen, brandy and cork
goods. Its harbour, El Gráo de Castellón, about 4 m. east, is
annually entered by some 200 small vessels. A light railway,
which traverses the numerous and profitable orange plantations
on the south-west, connects it with the towns of Almazora,
Villarreal, Burriana and Onda. Under its Moorish rulers
Castellón occupied a hill to the north of its present site; its
removal to the plain by James I. of Aragon (1213-1276) gave
the town its full name, &ldquo;Castellón of the Plain.&rdquo;</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASTELNAU, MICHEL DE,<a name="ar194" id="ar194"></a></span> <span class="sc">Sieur de la Mauvissière</span>
(c. 1520-1592), French soldier and diplomatist, ambassador to
Queen Elizabeth, was born in Touraine about 1520. He was
one of a large family of children, and his grandfather, Pierre de
Castelnau, was equerry to Louis XII. Endowed with a clear
and penetrating intellect and remarkable strength of memory,
he received a careful education, to complete which he travelled
in Italy and made a long stay at Rome. He then spent some
time in Malta, afterwards entered the army, and made his first
acquaintance with war in the campaigns of the French in Italy.
His abilities and his courage won for him the friendship and protection
of the cardinal of Lorraine, who took him into his service.
In 1557 a command in the navy was given to him, and the
cardinal proposed to get him knighted. This, however, he declined,
and then rejoined the French army in Picardy. Various
delicate missions requiring tact and discretion were entrusted
to him by the constable de Montmorency, and these he discharged
so satisfactorily that he was sent by the king, Henry II., to
Scotland with despatches for Mary Stuart, then betrothed to
the dauphin (afterwards Francis II.). From Scotland he passed
into England, and treated with Queen Elizabeth respecting her
claims on Calais (1559), a settlement of which was effected at
the congress of Cateau-Cambrésis. He was next sent as ambassador
to the princes of Germany, for the purpose of prevailing
upon them to withdraw their favour from the Protestants.
This embassy was followed by missions to Margaret of Parma,
governess of the Netherlands, to Savoy, and then to Rome, to
ascertain the views of Pope Paul IV. with regard to France.
Paul having died just before his arrival, Castelnau used his
influence in favour of the election of Pius IV. Returning to
France, he once more entered the navy, and served under his
former patron. It was his good fortune, at Nantes, to discover
the earliest symptoms of the conspiracy of Amboise, which he
immediately reported to the government.</p>

<p>After the death of Francis II. (December 1560) he accompanied
the queen, Mary Stuart, to Scotland, and remained with
her a year, during which time he made several journeys into
England, and attempted to bring about a reconciliation between
Mary and Queen Elizabeth. The wise and moderate counsels
which he offered to the former were unheeded. In 1562, in
consequence of the civil war in France, he returned there. He
was employed against the Protestants in Brittany, was taken
prisoner in an engagement with them and sent to Havre, but
was soon after exchanged. In the midst of the excited passions
of his countrymen, Castelnau, who was a sincere Catholic, maintained
a wise self-control and moderation, and by his counsels
rendered valuable service to the government. He served at the
siege of Rouen, distinguished himself at the battle of Dreux,
took Tancarville, and contributed in 1563 to the recapture of
Havre from the English.</p>

<p>During the next ten years Castelnau was employed in
various important missions:&mdash;first to Queen Elizabeth, to
negotiate a peace; next to the duke of Alba, the new governor
of the Netherlands. On this occasion he discovered the
project formed by the prince of Condé and Admiral Coligny
to seize and carry off the royal family at Monceaux (1567).
After the battle of St Denis he was again sent to Germany
to solicit aid against the Protestants; and on his return
he was rewarded for his services with the post of governor of
Saint-Dizier and a company of orderlies. At the head of his
company he took part in the battles of Jarnac and Moncontour.
In 1572 he was sent to England by Charles IX. to allay the
excitement created by the massacre of St Bartholomew, and
the same year he was sent to Germany and Switzerland. Two
years later he was reappointed by Henry III. ambassador to
Queen Elizabeth, and he remained at her court for ten years.
During this period he used his influence to promote the marriage
of the queen with the duke of Alençon, with a view especially
to strengthen and maintain the alliance of the two countries.
But Elizabeth made so many promises only to break them that
at last he refused to accept them or communicate them to his
government. On his return to France he found that his château
of La Mauvissière had been destroyed in the civil war; and as
he refused to recognize the authority of the League, the duke of
Guise deprived him of the governorship of Saint-Dizier. He
was thus brought almost to a state of destitution. But on the
accession of Henry IV., the king, who knew his worth, and was
confident that although he was a Catholic he might rely on his
fidelity, gave him a command in the army, and entrusted him
with various confidential missions.</p>

<p>Castelnau died at Joinville in 1592. His <i>Mémoires</i> rank very
high among the original authorities for the period they cover,
the eleven years between 1559 and 1570. They were written
during his last embassy in England for the benefit of his son;
and they possess the merits of clearness, veracity and impartiality.
They were first printed in 1621; again, with
additions by Le Laboureur, in 2 vols. folio, in 1659; and a third
time, still further enlarged by Jean Godefroy, 3 vols. folio, in
1731. Castelnau translated into French the Latin work of
Ramus, <i>On the Manners and Customs of the Ancient Gauls</i>.
Various letters of his are preserved in the Cottonian and Harleian
collections in the British Museum.</p>

<p>His grandson, <span class="sc">Jacques de Castelnau</span> (1620-1658), distinguished
himself in the war against Austria and Spain during the
ministries of Richelieu and Mazarin, and died marshal of France.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASTELNAUDARY,<a name="ar195" id="ar195"></a></span> a town of south-western France, capital
of an arrondissement in the department of Aude, 22 m. W.N.W.
of Carcassonne, on the Southern railway between that city
and Toulouse. Pop. (1906) 6650. It is finely situated on an
elevation in the midst of a fertile and well-cultivated plain; and
its commercial facilities are greatly increased by the Canal du
Midi, which widens out, as it passes the town, into an extensive
basin surrounded with wharves and warehouses for the timber
used in the upkeep of the canal. The principal buildings are
the law court, the hôtel de ville, and the church of St Michel,
dating from the 14th century; none of these offers any feature
of unusual interest. There are a number of flour-mills, as well
as manufactories of earthenware, tiles and blankets; an extensive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page474" id="page474"></a>474</span>
trade is maintained in lime, gypsum, timber, grain, fruits, wine,
wool, cattle and farm implements, and the building of canal
boats forms an important industry. The public institutions
include the sub-prefecture, tribunals of first instance and of
commerce, a communal college and a farm school.</p>

<p>Castelnaudary probably represents the ancient town of
<i>Sostomagus</i>, taken during the 5th century by the Visigoths,
who, it is conjectured, rebuilt the town, calling it <i>Castrum
Novum Arianorum</i>, whence the present name. Early in the 13th
century the town was the scene of several struggles during the
war against the Albigenses, between Simon IV., count of Montfort,
and Raymond VI., count of Toulouse, and their supporters.
In 1229 it was deprived of its ramparts, and after these had been
rebuilt, it was captured and burned by the Black Prince in 1355,
but again rebuilt in 1366. In 1632 it was the scene of a cavalry
engagement in which the rebel Henry II., duke of Montmorency,
was defeated and captured by the royal troops.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASTELSARRASIN,<a name="ar196" id="ar196"></a></span> a town of south-western France, capital
of an arrondissement in the department of Tarn-et-Garonne,
12 m. W. of Montauban on the Southern railway. Pop. (1906)
town, 3189; commune, 7496. Castelsarrasin, situated on the
left bank of the lateral canal of the Garonne and about a mile
from the right bank of that river, is surrounded by promenades
occupying the site of the old fortifications. Its chief building is
the brick-built church of St Sauveur, which dates from the 13th
century. The administrative buildings are modern. The town
has a sub-prefecture, a tribunal of first instance, and a communal
college. The principal industrial establishment is the metal-foundry
of Sainte-Marguerite, where copper, tin and other
metals are worked; there are also flour-mills, saw-mills and
dye-works. Trade is in cattle, agricultural produce, wine,
baskets and game.</p>

<p>The name Castelsarrasin appears in the 13th century, when
the village of Villelongue was replaced by the present bastide.
Castrum Cerrucium, Castel-sur-Azine (from the neighbouring
stream, Azine) and Castellum Sarracenum are suggested derivations,
no one of which can be adopted with certainty.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASTI, GIOVANNI BATTISTA<a name="ar197" id="ar197"></a></span> (1721-1803), Italian poet, was
born of humble parents at Montefiascone, in the states of the
church, in 1721. He rose to the dignity of canon in the cathedral
of his native place, but gave up his chance of church preferment
to satisfy his gay and restless spirit by visiting most of the capitals
of Europe. In 1782, on the death of Metastasio, he was appointed
<i>Poeta Cesario</i>, or poet-laureate of Austria, in which capacity he
applied himself with great success to the opera bouffe; but in
1796 he resigned this post, in order that he might not be
hampered by political relations; and he spent the close of his
life as a private gentleman at Paris, where he died in 1803. Casti
is best known as the author of the <i>Novelle galanti</i>, and of <i>Gli
Animali parlanti</i>, a poetical allegory, over which he spent eight
years (1794-1802), and which, notwithstanding its tedious length,
excited so much interest that it was translated into French,
German and Spanish, and (very freely and with additions) into
English, in W.S. Rose&rsquo;s <i>Court and Parliament of Beasts</i> (Lond.,
1819). Written during the time of the Revolution in France, it
was intended to exhibit the feelings and hopes of the people and
the defects and absurdities of various political systems. The
<i>Novelle Galanti</i> is a series of poetical tales, in the <i>ottava rima</i>&mdash;a
metre largely used by Italian poets for that class of compositions.
The sole merit of these poems consists in the harmony and purity
of the style, and the liveliness and sarcastic power of many
passages. They are, however, characterized by the grossest
licentiousness; and there is no originality of plot&mdash;that,
according to the custom of Italian novelists, being taken from
classical mythology or other ancient legends. Among the other
works of Casti is the <i>Poema Tartaro</i>, a mock-heroic satire on the
court of Catherine II., with which he was personally acquainted.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASTIGLIONE, BALDASSARE<a name="ar198" id="ar198"></a></span> (1478-1529), Italian diplomatist
and man of letters, was born at Casanatico near Mantua, and was
educated at Milan under the famous professors Merula and
Chalcondyles. In 1496 he entered the service of Lodovico Sforza,
duke of Milan, returning to Mantua in 1500 when Lodovico was
carried prisoner into France. In 1504 he was attached to the
court of Guidobaldo Malatesta, duke of Urbino, and in 1506 he
was sent by that prince on a mission to Henry VII. of England,
who had before conferred on Federigo Malatesta, &ldquo;the Good
Duke,&rdquo; the most famous mercenary of his age, the order of the
Garter. Guidobaldo dying childless in 1508, the duchy of Urbino
was given to Francesco Maria della Rovere, for whom Castiglione,
envoy at the court of Leo X. (Medici), obtained the office of
generalissimo of the Papal troops. Charged with the arrangement
of the dispute between Clement VII. (Medici) and Charles V.,
Castiglione crossed, in 1524, into Spain, where he was received
with highest honours, being afterwards naturalized, and made
bishop of Avila. In 1527, however, Rome was seized and sacked
by the Imperialists under Bourbon, and in July of the same
year the surrender of the castle of Sant&rsquo; Angelo placed Clement
in their hands. Castiglione had been tricked by the emperor,
but there were not wanting accusations of treachery against
himself. He had, however, placed fidelity highest among the
virtues of his ideal &ldquo;courtier,&rdquo; and when he died at Toledo in
1529 it was said that he had died of grief and shame at the
imputation. The emperor mourned him as &ldquo;one of the world&rsquo;s
best cavaliers.&rdquo; A portrait of him, now at the Louvre, was
painted by Raphael, who disdained neither his opinion nor his
advice.</p>

<p>Castiglione wrote little, but that little is of rare merit. His
verses, in Latin and Italian, are elegant in the extreme; his
letters (Padua, 1769-1771) are full of grace and finesse. But the
book by which he is best remembered is the famous treatise, <i>Il
Cortegiano</i>, written in 1514, published at Venice by Aldus in
1528, and translated into English by Thomas Hoby as early as
1561. This book, called by the Italians <i>Il Libra d&rsquo;oro</i>, and
remarkable for its easy force and undemonstrative elegance of
style no less than for the nobility and manliness of its theories
(see the edition by V. Cian, Florence, 1894), describes the Italian
gentleman of the Renaissance under his brightest and fairest
aspect, and gives a charming picture of the court of Guidobaldo
da Montefeltre, duke of Urbino, &ldquo;confessedly the purest and
most elevated court in Italy.&rdquo; In the form of a discussion held
in the duchess&rsquo;s drawing-room&mdash;with Elizabetta Gonzaga,
Pietro Bembo, Bernardo Bibbiena, Giuliano de&rsquo; Medici, Emilia
Pia, and Ceretino the Unique among the speakers&mdash;the question,
What constitutes a perfect courtier? is debated. With but few
differences, the type determined on is the ideal gentleman of the
present day.</p>

work was done in connexion with the Arabic and other Oriental

learned <i>Mémoire géographique et numismatique sur la partie

by himself the Gothic version of the second epistle of Paul to the
Corinthians; and this was followed by the Gothic version of the
epistle to the Romans, the first epistle to the Corinthians, and

<p><span class="bold">CASTIGLIONE, GIOVANNI BENEDETTO<a name="ar200" id="ar200"></a></span> (1616-1670), called
in Italy Il Grechetto, and in France Le Benédette, Italian
painter of the Genoese school, was born in Genoa, and studied
for some time under Vandyck. He painted portraits, historical
pieces and landscapes, but chiefly excelled in fairs, markets and
rural scenes with animals. Noah and the animals entering the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page475" id="page475"></a>475</span>
Ark was a favourite subject of his. His paintings are to be found
in Rome, Venice, Naples, Florence, and more especially Genoa
and Mantua. He also executed a number of etchings, which
are spirited, free and full of taste; &ldquo;Diogenes searching for
a Man&rdquo; is one of the principal of these. The etchings are
remarkable for light and shade, and have even earned for Castiglione
the name of &ldquo;a second Rembrandt.&rdquo; The <i>Presepio</i>
(Nativity of Jesus) in the church of San Luca, Genoa, ranks
among his most celebrated paintings, and the Louvre contains
eight characteristic examples. In his closing years he lived in
Mantua, painting for the court; here he received his name of
&ldquo;Grechetto,&rdquo; from the classic air of his pastorals, and here he
died of gout in 1670. His brother Salvatore and his son Francesco
excelled in the same subjects; and it is thought that many
paintings which are ascribed to Benedetto are only copies after
him, or perhaps originals by his son or brother.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASTILE,<a name="ar203" id="ar203"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Castille</span> (<i>Castilla</i>), an ancient kingdom of Spain,
occupying the central districts of the Iberian Peninsula; and
bounded on the N. by the Bay of Biscay, N.E. by the Basque
Provinces and Navarre, E. by Aragon, S.E. by Valencia and
Murcia, S. by Andalusia, W. by Estremadura and Leon, and
N.W. by Asturias. Pop. (1900) 3,708,713; area, 55,307 sq. m.
The name <i>Castile</i> is commonly said to be derived from the
numerous frontier forts (<i>castillos</i>) erected in the middle ages
as a defence against the Moors. The northern part of the
kingdom, which was first freed from Moorish rule, is called
Old Castile (<i>Castilla la Vieja</i>); the southern, acquired later,
is called New Castile (<i>Castilla la Nueva</i>). These two divisions,
with a third known as North Castile, now rank as military
districts or captaincies-general; but the term &ldquo;North Castile,&rdquo;
which covers the northern extremity of Old Castile, is not
generally used. In 1833 Old Castile was divided into the provinces
of Ávila, Burgos, Logroño, Palencia, Santander, Segovia,
Soria and Valladolid; while New Castile was similarly divided
into Ciudad Real, Cuenca, Guadalajara, Madrid and Toledo.
The modern progress of commerce, communications, &amp;c. in
these thirteen provinces is described in the separate articles upon
each of them.</p>

<p>Castile extends for about 300 m. from north to south, and
160 m. from east to west. It consists of a vast central plateau,
with an average altitude of about 2500 ft. This plateau has
a natural frontier of high mountains on all sides, except on the
borders of Leon and Murcia; it is also bisected by the Sierra
de Guadarrama and Sierra de Grédos, which extend in a south-westerly
direction across the central districts, and form the
dividing line between Old and New Castile. Geographically
it includes also the high plains of Leon, towards the north-west,
and of Murcia on the south-east. The existing frontier is marked
on the north by the Cantabrian Mountains (<i>q.v.</i>); on the east
by the Sierra de la Demanda with its offshoots, and by the
Serrania de Cuenca; on the south by the Sierra Morena; and
on the west by various minor ranges which link together the
three more or less parallel chains of the Sierra de Grédos, Sierra
de Guadalupe and Sierra Morena. Three great rivers, the
Douro, which traverses Old Castile, with the Tagus and Guadiana,
which respectively drain the central and southern regions of
New Castile, flow westward into Portugal, and finally reach the
Atlantic; while the Ebro, which rises in the north of the kingdom,
skirts the north-eastern frontier on its way to the Mediterranean.
These rivers are described under their own names.</p>

<p>The climate of Old Castile is healthy, but liable to severe cold
and heat. Snow falls early and lies late in the mountains, and
there is a heavy rainfall in the north-west. New Castile has a
still more rigorous climate, for although the mean annual temperature
is about 59° Fahr., the summer heat in the valleys is
peculiarly oppressive, and the highlands are swept by scorching
or icy gales, laden with dust. The rainfall rarely exceeds 10 in. in
a year.</p>

<p>In both the Castiles the central plateau has a naturally fertile
soil, for after rain a luxuriant vegetation appears; but drought
is common, owing to the insufficient volume of the rivers, and
the failure of the Spaniards to extend the fine system of irrigation
which the Moors originated. Certain districts, indeed, in which
a layer of heavy loam underlies the porous and friable surface,
are able to retain the moisture which elsewhere is absorbed.
Such land is found in Palencia, and in the Mesa de Ocaña, where
it yields abundant crops; and many of the northern mountains
are well wooded. But vast tracts of land are useless except as
pasture for sheep, and even the sheep are driven by the severe
winters to migrate yearly into Estremadura (<i>q.v.</i>). The normal
Castilian landscape is an arid and sterile steppe, with scarcely
a tree or spring of water; and many even of the villages afford
no relief to the eye, for they are built of sunburnt unbaked
bricks, which share the dusty brownish-grey tint of the soil.
Especially characteristic is the great plain of La Mancha (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p>The transformation of Castile from a small county in the north
of what is now Old Castile into an independent monarchy, was
one of the decisive events in the reconquest of Spain from the
Moors. The successful resistance offered by Asturias to the
invaders had been followed by the liberation of Galicia and Leon,
when Ferdinand I. of Castile (1035-1065), by his marriage
with Sancha, widow of the last king of Leon, was enabled to
unite Leon and Castile in a single kingdom, with its capital at
Burgos. New territories were annexed on the south, until, after
the capture of Toledo in 1085, and the consequent formation
of a New Castile, the kingdom comprised the whole of central
Spain. Thenceforward its history is inseparable from that of
the whole country; and it is therefore described in full, together
with the language and literature of Castile, under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Spain</a></span> (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p>Castilian, which is the literary language of Spain, and with
certain differences, of Spanish America, is spoken in Old and
New Castile, Aragon, Estremadura, and the greater part of
Leon; in Andalusia it is subject to various modifications of
accent and pronunciation. As there is little, if any, difference
of racial origin, character and physical type, among the inhabitants
of this region, except in Andalusia, and, to a less extent,
in Estremadura, the Castilian is justly regarded as the typical
Spaniard. Among the Castilian peasantry, where education
and foreign influence have never penetrated deeply, the national
character can best be studied. Its intense pride, its fatalistic
indolence and ignorance, its honesty and its bigotry, tempered
by a keen sense of humour, are well-known characteristics.
Apart from the peasant class, Castilians have contributed more
to the development of Spanish art and literature than the inhabitants
of any other region except, perhaps, Andalusia, which
claims to be regarded as supreme in architecture and painting.
Of the two great Spanish universities, Alcalá de Henares belonged
in all respects to Castile, and Salamanca rose to equality with
Paris, Oxford or Bologna, under the purely Castilian influence
of Alphonso X. (1252-1284).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASTILHO, ANTONIO FELICIANO DE<a name="ar204" id="ar204"></a></span> (1800-1875), Portuguese
man of letters, was born at Lisbon. He lost his sight
at the age of six, but the devotion of his brother Augusto, aided
by a retentive memory, enabled him to go through his school
and university course with success; and he acquired an almost
complete mastery of the Latin language and literature. His
first work of importance, the <i>Cartas de Echo e Narciso</i> (1821),
belongs to the pseudo-classical school in which he had been
brought up, but his romantic leanings became apparent in the
<i>Primavera</i> (1822) and in <i>Amor e Melancholia</i> (1823), two volumes
of honeyed and prolix bucolic poetry. In the poetic legends
<i>A noite de Castello</i> (1836) and <i>Cuimes do bardo</i> (1838) Castilho
appeared as a full-blown Romanticist. These books exhibit
the defects and qualities of all his work, in which lack of ideas
and of creative imagination and an atmosphere of artificiality
are ill compensated for by a certain emotional charm, great
purity of diction and melodious versification. Belonging to the
didactic and descriptive school, Castilho saw nature as all
sweetness, pleasure and beauty, and he lived in a dreamland
of his imagination. A fulsome epic on the succession of King
John VI. brought him an office of profit at Coimbra. On his
return from a stay in Madeira, he founded the <i>Revista Universal
Lisbonense</i>, in imitation of Herculano&rsquo;s <i>Panorama</i>, and his
profound knowledge of the Portuguese classics served him well
in the introduction and notes to a very useful publication, the
<i>Livraria Classica Portugueza</i> (1845-1847, 25 vols.), while two
years later he established the &ldquo;Society of the Friends of Letters
and the Arts.&rdquo; A study on Camoens and treatises on metrification
and mnemonics followed from his pen. His praiseworthy
zeal for popular instruction led him to take up the study
of pedagogy, and in 1850 he brought out his <i>Leitura Repentina</i>,
a method of reading which was named after him, and he became
government commissary of the schools which were destined
to put it into practice. Going to Brazil in 1854, he there wrote
his famous &ldquo;Letter to the Empress.&rdquo; Though Castilho&rsquo;s lack
of strong individuality and his over-great respect for authority
prevented him from achieving original work of real merit, yet
his translations of Anacreon, Ovid and Virgil and the <i>Chave do
Enigma</i>, explaining the romantic incidents that led to his first
marriage with D. Maria de Baena, a niece of the satirical poet
Tolentino, and a descendant of Antonio Ferreira, reveal him
as a master of form and a purist in language. His versions of
Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Faust</i> and Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>,
made without a knowledge of German and English, scarcely added
to his reputation. When the Coimbra question arose in 1865,
Garrett was dead and Herculano had ceased to write, leaving
Castilho supreme, for the moment, in the realm of letters.
But the youthful Anthero de Quental withstood his claim to
direct the rising generation and attacked his superannuated
leadership, and after a fierce war of pamphlets Castilho was
dethroned. The rise of João de Deus reduced him to a secondary
position in the Portuguese Parnassus, and when he died ten years
later much of his former fame had preceded him to the tomb.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASTILLEJO, CRISTÓBAL DE<a name="ar205" id="ar205"></a></span> (1490-1556), Spanish poet,
was born at Ciudad Rodrigo in 1490. In 1518 he left Spain
with Ferdinand of Austria, afterwards emperor, whose private
secretary he eventually became. While residing at Vienna in
1528-1530 he wrote the <i>Historia de Píramo y Tisbe</i>, and dedicated
it to Anna von Schaumberg, with whom he had a platonic
love-affair. He seems to have visited Venice, to have been
neglected by his patron, to have fallen ill in 1540, and to have
passed his last years in poverty. He died on the 12th of June
1556, and was buried at Vienna. Castillejo&rsquo;s poems are interesting,
not merely because of their intrinsic excellence, but also as
being the most powerful protest against the metrical innovations
imported from Italy by Boscán and Garcilaso de la
Vega. He adheres to the native <i>quintillas</i> or to the <i>coplas de
pie quebrado</i>, and only abandons these traditional forms when
he indulges in caustic parody of the new school&mdash;as in the lines
<i>Contra los que dejan los metros castellanos</i>. He excels by virtue
of his charming simplicity and his ingenious wit, always keen,
sometimes licentious, never brutal. The urbane gaiety of his
occasional poems is delightfully spontaneous, and the cynical
humour which informs the <i>Diálogo de las condiciones de las
mujeres</i> and the <i>Diálogo de la vida de la corte</i> is impregnated with
the Renaissance spirit. Castillejo is the Clément Marot of
Spain. His plays are lost; the best text of his verses is that

<p><span class="bold">CASTILLO SOLÓRZANO, ALONSO DE<a name="ar206" id="ar206"></a></span> (1584?-1647?), Spanish
novelist and playwright, is stated to have been baptized at
Tordesillas near Valladolid on 1st October 1584. Nothing is
known of his youth, and he is next heard of at Madrid in
1619 as a man of literary tastes. While in the service of the
marquis de Villar, he issued his first work, <i>Donaires del Parnaso</i>
(1624-1625), two volumes of humorous poems; his <i>Tardes
entretenidas</i> (1625) and <i>Jornadas alegres</i> (1626) proved that he
was a novelist by vocation. Shortly afterwards he joined the
household of the marquis de los Vélez, viceroy of Valencia, and
published in quick succession three clever picaresque novels:
<i>La Niña de los embustes, Teresa de Manzanares</i> (1634), <i>Las
Aventuras del Bachiller Trapaza</i> (1637), and a continuation
entitled <i>La Garduña de Sevilla y Anzuelo de las bolsas</i> (1642).
To these shrewd cynical stories he owes his reputation. He
followed the marquis de los Vélez in his disastrous campaign
in Catalonia, and accompanied him to Rome, where the defeated
general was sent as ambassador. Castillo Solórzano&rsquo;s death
occurred (probably at Palermo) before 1648, but the exact date
is uncertain. His prolonged absence from Madrid prevented
him from writing as copiously for the stage as he would otherwise
have done; but he was popular as a playwright both at
home and abroad. His <i>Marqués del Cigarral</i> and <i>El Mayorazgo
figurón</i> are the sources respectively of Scarron&rsquo;s <i>Don Jophet
d&rsquo;Arménie</i> and <i>L&rsquo;Héritier ridicule</i>. Among his numerous remaining
works may be mentioned <i>Las Harpías en Madrid</i> (1633),
<i>Fiestas del Jardín</i> (1634), <i>Los Alivios de Casandra</i> (1640) and the
posthumous <i>Quinta de Laurel</i> (1649); the witty observation of
these books forms a singular contrast to the prim devotion of
his <i>Sagrario de Valencia</i> (1635). His versatility and graceful
style deserve the highest praise.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASTLE<a name="ar207" id="ar207"></a></span> (Lat. <i>castellum</i>, a fort, diminutive of <i>castra</i>, a camp;
Fr. <i>château</i> and <i>chátel</i>), a small self-contained fortress, usually
of the middle ages, though the term is sometimes used of prehistoric
earthworks (<i>e.g.</i> Hollingbury Castle, Maiden Castle),
and sometimes of citadels (<i>e.g.</i> the castles of Badajoz and Burgos)
and small detached <i>forts d&rsquo;arrêt</i> in modern times. It is also often
applied to the principal mansion of a prince or nobleman, and
in France (as <i>château</i>) to any country seat, this use being a relic
of the feudal age. Under its twofold aspect of a fortress and a
residence, the medieval castle is inseparably connected with the
subjects of fortification (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fortification and Siegecraft</a></span>)
and architecture (<i>q.v.</i>). An account of Roman and pre-Roman

<p>The word &ldquo;castle&rdquo; (<i>castel</i>) was introduced into English
shortly before the Norman Conquest to denote a type of fortress,
then new to the country, brought in by the Norman knights
whom Edward the Confessor had sent for to defend Herefordshire
against the inroads of the Welsh. Richard&rsquo;s castle, of
which the earthworks remain and which has given its name
to a parish, was erected at this period on the border of Herefordshire
and Shropshire by Richard Fitz Scrob. The essential
feature of this type was a circular mound of earth surrounded
by a dry ditch and flattened at the top. Around the crest of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page477" id="page477"></a>477</span>
its summit was placed a timber palisade. This moated mound
was styled in French <i>motte</i> (latinized <i>mota</i>), a word still common
in French place-names. It is clearly depicted at the time of
the Conquest in the Bayeux tapestry, and was then familiar
on the mainland of western Europe. A description of this earlier
castle is given in the life of John, bishop of Terouanne (<i>Acta
Sanctorum</i>, quoted by G.T. Clark, <i>Medieval Mil. Architecture</i>):&mdash;&ldquo;The
rich and the noble of that region being much given to
feuds and bloodshed, fortify themselves ... and by these
strongholds subdue their equals and oppress their inferiors. They
heap up a mound as high as they are able, and dig round it as
broad a ditch as they can.... Round the summit of the mound
they construct a palisade of timber to act as a wall....
Inside the palisade they
erect a house, or rather
a citadel, which looks
down on the whole
neighbourhood.&rdquo; St
John, bishop of Terouanne,
died in 1130, and
this castle of Merchem,
built by &ldquo;a lord of the
town many years before&rdquo;
may be taken as
typical of the practice of
the 11th century. But
in addition to the mound,
the citadel of the fortress,
there was usually
appended to it a bailey
or basecourt (and sometimes
two) of semilunar
or horseshoe shape, so
that the mound stood <i>à
cheval</i> on the line of the
enceinte. The rapidity
and ease with which it was possible to construct castles of this
type made them characteristic of the Conquest period in England
and of the Anglo-Norman settlements in Wales, Ireland and
the Scottish lowlands. In later days a stone wall replaced the
timber palisade and produced what is known as the shell-keep,
the type met with in the extant castles of Berkeley, Alnwick and
Windsor.</p>

<p>But the Normans introduced also two other types of castle.
The one was adopted where they found a natural rock stronghold
which only needed adaptation, as at Clifford, Ludlow, the
Peak and Exeter, to produce a citadel; the other was a type
wholly distinct, the high rectangular tower of masonry, of which
the Tower of London is the best-known example, though that of
Colchester was probably constructed in the 11th century also.
But the latter type belongs rather to the more settled conditions
of the 12th century when haste was not a necessity, and in
the first half of which the fine extant keeps of Hedingham
and Rochester were erected. These towers were originally surrounded
by palisades, usually on earthen ramparts, which were
replaced later by stone walls. The whole fortress thus formed
was styled a castle, but sometimes more precisely &ldquo;tower and
castle,&rdquo; the former being the citadel, and the latter the walled
enclosure, which preserved more strictly the meaning of the
Roman <i>castellum</i>.</p>

<p>Reliance was placed by the engineers of that time simply and
solely on the inherent strength of the structure, the walls of
which defied the battering-ram, and could only be undermined
at the cost of much time and labour, while the narrow apertures
were constructed to exclude arrows or flaming brands.</p>

<p>At this stage the crusades, and the consequent opportunities
afforded to western engineers of studying the solid fortresses
of the Byzantine empire, revolutionized the art of castle-building,
which henceforward follows recognized principles.
Many castles were built in the Holy Land by the crusaders of
the 12th century, and it has been shown (Oman, <i>Art of War:
the Middle Ages</i>, p. 529) that the designers realized, first, that a
second line of defences should be built within the main enceinte,
and a third line or keep inside the second line; and secondly, that
a wall must be flanked by projecting towers. From the Byzantine
engineers, through the crusaders, we derive, therefore, the
cardinal principle of the mutual defence of all the parts of a
fortress. The <i>donjon</i> of western Europe was regarded as the
fortress, the outer walls
as accessory defences; in
the East each envelope
was a fortress in itself, and
the keep became merely
the last refuge of the
garrison, used only when
all else had been captured.
Indeed the keep, in several
crusader castles, is no
more than a tower, larger
than the rest, built into
the enceinte and serving
with the rest for its
flanking defence, while the fortress was made strongest on the
most exposed front. The idea of the flanking towers (which
were of a type very different from the slight projections of the
shell-keep and rectangular tower) soon penetrated to Europe,
and Alnwick Castle
(1140-1150) shows the
influence of the new
system. But the finest
of all castles of the
middle ages was Richard
Coeur de Lion&rsquo;s fortress
of Château Gaillard
(1197) on the Seine near
Les Andelys. Here the
innermost ward was
protected by an elaborate
system of strong
appended defences,
which included a strong
<i>tête-de-pont</i> covering the Seine bridge (see Clark, i. 384, and Oman,
p. 533). The castle stood upon high ground and consisted of
three distinct enceintes or wards besides the keep, which was
in this case merely a strong tower forming part of the innermost
ward. The donjon was rarely defended <i>à outrance</i>, and it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page478" id="page478"></a>478</span>
gradually sank in importance as the outer &ldquo;wards&rdquo; grew stronger.
Round instead of rectangular towers were now becoming usual,
the finest examples of their employment as keeps being at
Conisborough in England and at Coucy in France. Against
the relatively feeble siege artillery of the 13th century a well-built
fortress was almost proof, but the mines and the battering
ram of the attack were more formidable, and it was realized that
corners in the stonework of the fortress were more vulnerable
than a uniform curved surface. Château Gaillard fell to Philip
Augustus in 1204 after a strenuous defence, and the success of
the assailants was largely due to the wise and skilful employment
of mines. An angle of the noble keep of Rochester was
undermined and brought down by John in 1215.</p>

<p>The next development was the extension of the principle of
successive lines of defence to form what is called the &ldquo;concentric&rdquo;
castle, in which each ward was placed wholly within
another which enveloped it; places thus built on a flat side
(<i>e.g.</i> Caerphilly Castle) became for the first time more formidable
than strongholds perched upon rocks and hills such as Château
Gaillard, where the more exposed parts indeed possessed many
successive lines of defence, but at other points, for want of
room, it was impossible to build more than one or, at most, two
walls. In these cases, the fall of the inner ward by surprise,
escalade, <i>vive force</i>, or even
by regular siege (as was
sometimes feasible), entailed
the fall of the whole castle.</p>

<p>The adoption of the concentric
system precluded
any such mischance, and
thus, even though siege-engines
improved during
the 13th and 14th centuries,
the defence, by the
massive strength of the
concentric castle in some
cases, by natural inaccessibility
of position in others,
maintained itself superior
to the attack during the
latter middle ages. Its
final fall was due to the
introduction of gunpowder
as a propellant. &ldquo;In the
14th century the change
begins, in the 15th it is fully developed, in the 16th the feudal
fastness has become an anachronism.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The general adoption of cannon placed in the hands of the
central power a force which ruined the baronial fortifications in
a few days of firing. The possessors of cannon were usually
private individuals of the middle classes, from whom the prince
hired the <i>matériel</i> and the technical workmen. A typical case
will be found in the history of Brandenburg and Prussia (Carlyle,
<i>Frederick the Great</i>, bk. iii. ch. i.), the impregnable castle of
Friesack, held by an intractable feudal noble, Dietrich von
Quitzow, being reduced in two days by the elector Frederick. I.
with &ldquo;Heavy Peg&rdquo; (<i>Faule Grete</i>) and other guns hired and
borrowed (February 1414). The beginnings of orderly government
in Brandenburg thus depended upon the guns, and the
taking of Friesack is, in Carlyle&rsquo;s phrase, &ldquo;a fact memorable to
every Prussian man.&rdquo; In England, the earl of Warwick in 1464
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page479" id="page479"></a>479</span>
reduced the strong fortress of Bamborough in a week, and in
Germany, Franz von Sinkingen&rsquo;s stronghold of Landstuhl,
formerly impregnable on its heights, was ruined in one day by
the artillery of Philip of Hesse (1523). Very heavy artillery was
used for such work, of course, and against lighter natures, some
castles and even fortified country-houses or castellated mansions
managed to make a stout stand
even as late as the Great
Rebellion in England.</p>

<p>The castle thus ceases to be
the fortress of small and ill-governing
local magnates, and
its later history is merged in
that of modern fortification.
But an interesting transitional
type between the medieval
stronghold and the modern
fortress is found in the coast
castles erected by Henry VIII.,
especially those at Deal, Sandown
and Walmer (c. 1540),
which played some part in the
events of the 17th century, and
of which Walmer Castle is still
the official residence of the lord
warden of the Cinque Ports. Viollet-le-Duc, in his <i>Annals of a
Fortress</i> (English trans.), gives a full and interesting account of
the repeated renovations of the fortress on his imaginary site in
the valley of the Doubs, the construction by Charles the Bold of
artillery towers at the angles of the castle, the protection of the
masonry by earthen outworks, boulevards and demi-boulevards,
and, in the 17th century, the final service of the medieval walls
and towers as a pure <i>enceinte de sûreté</i>. Here and there we find
old castles serving as <i>forts d&rsquo;arrêt</i> or block-houses in mountain
passes and defiles, and in some few cases, as at Dover, they
formed the nucleus of purely military places of arms, but normally
the castle falls into ruins, becomes a peaceful mansion, or is
merged in the fortifications of the town which has grown up
around it. In the <i>Annals of a Fortress</i> the site of the feudal
castle is occupied by the citadel of the walled town, for once
again, with the development of the middle class and of commerce
and industry, the art of the engineer came to be displayed chiefly
in the fortification of cities. The baronial &ldquo;castle&rdquo; assumes
<i>pari passu</i> the form of a mansion, retaining indeed for long some
capacity for defence, but in the end losing all military characteristics
save a few which survived as ornaments. Examples of
such castellated mansions are seen in Wingfield Manor, Derbyshire,
and Hurstmonceaux, Sussex, erected in the 15th century, and
nearly all older castles which survived were continually improved
and altered to serve as residences.</p>

<p><i>Influence of Castles in English History.</i>&mdash;Such strongholds as
existed in England at the time of the Norman Conquest seem to
have offered but little resistance to William the Norman, who,
in order effectually to guard against invasions from without as
well as to awe his newly-acquired subjects, immediately began
to erect castles all over the kingdom, and likewise to repair and
augment the old ones. Besides, as he had parcelled out the
lands of the English amongst his followers, they, to protect
themselves from the resentment of the despoiled natives, built
strongholds and castles on their estates, and these were multiplied
so rapidly during the troubled reign of King Stephen that the
&ldquo;adulterine&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> unauthorized)
castles are
said by one writer to have
amounted to 1115.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 350px;" summary="Illustration">

<p>In the first instance,
when the interest of the
king and of his barons
was identical, the former
had only retained in his
hands the castles in the
chief towns of the shires,
which were entrusted to
his sheriffs or constables.
But the great feudal revolts
under the Conqueror
and his sons showed how
formidable an obstacle to
the rule of the king was the
existence of such fortresses
in private hands, while the people hated them from the first for the
oppressions connected with their erection and maintenance. It
was, therefore, the settled policy of the crown to strengthen the
royal castles and increase their number, while jealously keeping in
check those of the barons. But in the struggle between Stephen
and the empress Maud for the crown, which became largely a war
of sieges, the royal power was relaxed and there was an outburst
of castle-building, without permission, by the barons. These in
many cases acted as petty sovereigns, and such was their tyranny
that the native chronicler describes the castles as &ldquo;filled with
devils and evil men.&rdquo; These excesses paved the way for the
pacification at the close of the reign, when it was provided that all
unauthorized castles constructed during its course should be
destroyed. Henry II., in spite of his power, was warned by the
great revolt against him that he must still rely on castles, and the
massive keeps of Newcastle and of Dover date from this period.</p>

<p>Under his sons the importance of the chief castles was recognized
as so great that the struggle for their control was in the
forefront of every contest. When Richard made vast grants at
his accession to his brother John, he was careful to reserve the
possession of certain castles, and when John rose against the
king&rsquo;s minister, Longchamp, in 1191, the custody of castles was the
chief point of dispute throughout their negotiations, and Lincoln
was besieged on the king&rsquo;s behalf, as were Tickhill, Windsor and
Marlborough subsequently, while the siege of Nottingham had to
be completed by Richard himself on his arrival. To John, in
turn, as king, the fall of Château Gaillard meant the loss of Rouen
and of Normandy with it, and when he endeavoured to repudiate
the newly-granted Great Charter, his first step was to prepare
the royal castles against attack and make them his centres of
resistance. The barons, who had begun their revolt by besieging
that of Northampton, now assailed that of Oxford as well and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page480" id="page480"></a>480</span>
seized that of Rochester. The king recovered Rochester after a
severe struggle and captured Tonbridge, but thenceforth there
was a war of sieges between John with his mercenaries and Louis
of France with his Frenchmen and the barons, which was specially
notable for the great defence of Dover Castle by Hubert de Burgh
against Louis. On the final triumph of the royal cause, after
John&rsquo;s death, at the battle of Lincoln, the general pacification
was accompanied by a fresh issue of the Great Charter in the
autumn of 1217, in which the precedent of Stephen&rsquo;s reign was
followed and a special clause inserted that all &ldquo;adulterine&rdquo;
castles, namely those which had been constructed or rebuilt since
the breaking out of war between John and the barons, should be
immediately destroyed. And special stress was laid on this in
the writs addressed to the sheriffs.</p>

<p>In 1223 Hubert de Burgh, as regent, demanded the surrender
to the crown of all royal castles not in official custody, and though
he succeeded in this, Falkes de Breauté, John&rsquo;s mercenary, burst
into revolt next year, and it cost a great national effort and a
siege of nearly two months to reduce Bedford Castle, which he had
held. Towards the close of Henry&rsquo;s reign castles again asserted,
in the Baron&rsquo;s War, their importance. The Provisions of Oxford
included a list of the chief royal castles and of their appointed
castellans with the oath that they were to take; but the alien
favourites refused to make way for them till they were forcibly
ejected. When war broke out it was Rochester Castle that
successfully held Simon de Montfort at bay in 1264, and in
Pevensey Castle that the fugitives from the rout of Lewes were
able to defy his power. Finally, after his fall at Evesham, it was
in Kenilworth Castle that the remnant of his followers made
their last stand, holding out nearly five months against all the
forces of the crown, till their provisions failed them at the close of
1266.</p>

<p>Thus for two centuries after the Norman Conquest castles had
proved of primary consequence in English political struggles,
revolts and warfare. And, although, when the country was
again torn by civil strife, their military importance was of small
account, the crown&rsquo;s historic jealousy of private fortification was
still seen in the need to obtain the king&rsquo;s licence to &ldquo;crenellate&rdquo;
(<i>i.e.</i> embattle) the country mansion.</p>

Ireland, in the west parliamentary division, on the river and near
the lough of the same name, on the Manulla and Westport branch
of the Midland Great Western railway. Pop. of urban district
(1901) 3585. The county court buildings and other public
offices occupy a square, and there is a pleasant mall shaded by
fine trees. There are some breweries, and trade in linens and
agricultural produce. The castle, which gives its name to the
town, was a fortress of the De Burgh family; but the town
itself was founded in the reign of James I., and received a charter
from him in 1613. In 1641 the castle was held for the parliament
by Sir Henry Bingham, but he was forced to surrender to Lord
Mayo, and fell a victim, with all his garrison, to the fury and
treachery of the besiegers. The massacre was afterwards
avenged in 1653 by the execution of Sir Theobald Burke (by
that time Lord Mayo), who had been in command along with
his father at the siege. In 1798 the town was occupied for some
weeks by the French under General J.J. Humbert, who had
defeated the English under Luke Hutchison in a conflict which
is jocularly styled the &ldquo;Castlebar Races.&rdquo; The town returned
two members to the Irish parliament until the Union. Four
miles N.E. of Castlebar is Turlough, with a round tower 70 ft.
high and 57 ft. in circumference, and other remains.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASTLECONNELL,<a name="ar209" id="ar209"></a></span> a village of Co. Limerick, Ireland, on
the left bank of the Shannon, 8 m. N.E. of Limerick on the
Great Southern &amp; Western railway. It possesses a spa which
was once considerably frequented, but is famous as a centre for
the salmon fishing on the lower Shannon. Castleconnell is so
intimately connected with this sport that it has given its name
to a favourite pattern of fly-rod, in which a movable splice takes
the place of the usual metal joint. The beautiful rapids of
Doonas (avoided by a canal) are in the neighbourhood, and the
surrounding scenery is generally attractive. There are remains
of a castle from which the town took its name, which was the
seat of the kings of Thomond, and was blown up by General
Ginkel at the time of the siege of Limerick (1690).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASTLE DONINGTON,<a name="ar210" id="ar210"></a></span> a town in the Loughborough parliamentary
division of Leicestershire, England, 123½ m. N.N.W.
from London, on the Trent Junction and Western branch of the
Midland railway. Pop. (1901) 2514. It lies on the flank of the
hills overlooking the Trent and Soar valleys. There are slight
remains of the castle. The church of St Luke is a fine building
of Early English and later date. Donington Park, a neighbouring
mansion, was offered to refugees during the French Revolution
in 1830, and Charles X. availed himself of this retreat.
Hosiery, silk and baskets are manufactured. Castle Donington
is 2½ m. west of Kegworth station on the Midland main line.
Kegworth (pop. 2078), on the Soar, has a hosiery and knitting
industry.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASTLE DOUGLAS,<a name="ar211" id="ar211"></a></span> a burgh of barony and police burgh of
Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland. Pop. (1901) 3018. It is situated
on Carlingwark Loch, 19½ m. S.W. of Dumfries by the Glasgow
&amp; South-Western railway. Its auction marts for sheep and
cattle sales are the largest in the south-west of Scotland; at
an autumn sale as many as 15,000 sheep and 1400 cattle are
disposed of in one day. The leading industries comprise the
making of agricultural implements and mineral waters, besides
tanning. The Macmillan Free Church perpetuates the memory
of John Macmillan (d. 1753), the Cameronian, who helped to
found the Reformed Presbyterian Church. He had been chaplain
to Murray of Broughton, and afterwards became minister of
Balmaghie, about 3½ m. N.W. of Castle Douglas. The town
is the chief centre of business in East Galloway, and it is also
resorted to in midsummer for its beautiful scenery and excellent
fishing. Till 1765 it was only a village under the name of
Causewayhead, but the discovery of marl in the lake brought it
some prosperity, and it was purchased in 1792 by Sir William
Douglas and called after him. Since then its progress has been
continuous. Carlingwark Loch contains several islets, on one
of which is a crannog, or ancient lake dwelling.</p>

of Leeds, on the North-Eastern and Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire
railways. Pop. (1901) 17,386. Large glass-bottle and earthenware-jar
works, chemical works, and neighbouring collieries
employ the inhabitants. Here was the Roman village or fort of
<i>Lagecium</i> or <i>Legeolium</i>; and though visible remains are wanting,
a number of relics have been discovered.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASTLE-GUARD,<a name="ar213" id="ar213"></a></span> an arrangement under the feudal system,
by which the duty of finding knights to guard royal castles was
imposed on certain baronies, and divided among their knight&rsquo;s
fees. The greater barons provided for the guard of their castles
by exacting a similar duty from their knights. In both cases the
obligation was commuted very early for a fixed money payment,
which, as &ldquo;castle-guard rent&rdquo; lasted on to modern times.</p>

gold-mines here were among the first discovered in the colony,
and dredging for gold is carried on in Barker&rsquo;s and Forrest creeks,
at the junction of which the town stands. Slate and flagstone
are largely quarried in the district, which also produces wine and

<p><span class="bold">CASTLE RISING,<a name="ar215" id="ar215"></a></span> a village of Norfolk, England, 4 m. by
road N.E. of King&rsquo;s Lynn. The Norman castle for which it is
famous stands on slightly elevated ground overlooking, to the
west, the low marshy coast of the Wash. Its site is enclosed by
artificial ramparts of earth and a dyke which is crossed by an
ancient bridge. The keep is square and massive, and fairly
perfect, and it is not difficult to reconstruct the arrangement of
the rooms. In some parts, especially the entrance, the Norman
carving is very rich. The foundations of a small chapel with
apsidal eastern termination have been discovered outside the
castle. The village of Castle Rising is the decayed remnant of a
town of no little importance. Its church of St Laurence is late
Norman, with much rich ornamentation; it shows traces of
considerable alterations in the Early English period, but is an
admirable example of the earlier style.</p>

<p>It is a matter of dispute whether Rising was or was not an
early Saxon settlement; in Domesday Book the manor is given
as having belonged to Archbishop Stigand, from whom it had
passed to Odo of Bayeux, whose estates were confiscated in 1088.
Granted to William de Albini, whose son built Rising Castle, it
passed first to Robert de Montalt, and then by sale to Isabel,
queen of England, in 1332, remaining in the possession of the
crown until Henry VIII. exchanged it for other lands with the
duke of Norfolk. In 1269 an inquisition found that the lord had
the return of all writs. In 1275 Robert de Montalt died seised
of the manor and vill with the assize of bread and ale. An
inquisition of 1379, although it makes no mention of the borough,
states that the lord has the rents of assizes, and perquisites of
the courts with view of frank-pledge. A mayor is first mentioned
in 1343, and a borough existed in the 15th century. A survey of
1589-1590 declared that Castle Rising was an ancient borough by
prescription according to the grant made to Hugh de Albini by
Henry III. In 1589-1590 the recorder was chosen by the lord
of the manor. The mayor, the only member of the corporation,
whose sole duty was the holding of the assize of bread and ale,
was chosen by the burgesses and presented at the court leet for
confirmation. Castle Rising became a parliamentary borough
in 1558, but was disfranchised in 1832 and the corporation
abolished in 1835, although a mayor was elected for special
purposes until 1883. Having no manufactures, the trade of the
town depended entirely on its fairs and markets; but these have
been long obsolete.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASTLETON,<a name="ar216" id="ar216"></a></span> a village in the High Peak parliamentary
division of Derbyshire, England, 17 m. W.S.W. of Sheffield, and
2 m. from Hope station on a branch of the Midland railway.
Pop. (1901) 547. Lying itself at an elevation of about 600 ft.,
it is surrounded on the north, west and south by hills from 1400
to 1700 ft. in height, rising sharply, and in parts precipitously.
The village is celebrated for its situation in the midst of the wild
Peak country, for the caves and mines in the neighbourhood, and
for the Castle of the Peak, the ruins of which are strongly placed
on a cliff immediately above the village. The Peak Cavern or
Devil&rsquo;s Hole, penetrating this cliff, is the most magnificent in
Derbyshire. For many generations the entrance to this cave
has served as a workshop, held free of rent, to families employed
in rope and twine making. Speedwell Cavern is not far distant,
at the entrance to the fine pass of Winnats, by which Castleton
and the Vale of Hope are approached from the west. The
beauties of this cavern, in which occurs the so-called bottomless
pit, are in part readily accessible by boat, but the approach to
the inner or Cliff cavern is so difficult that it has rarely been
explored. Among several other caves is that known as the
Blue John Mine, from the decorative fluorspar called &ldquo;Blue
John&rdquo; which is obtained here. The church of St Edmund,
Castleton, retains a fine Norman chancel arch, and the vestry
contains a valuable library. At Brough near Castleton was a
Roman fort, established to hold in check the hillmen of the Peak.
It was connected by roads with Buxton, Manchester and Rotherham.
The Castle of the Peak, or Peveril Castle, is famous
through Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s novel <i>Peveril of the Peak</i>. Early
earthworks, which, extending from below the castle in a semicircle,
enclosed the town, can still in great part be traced.
Before the Conquest the site was held by Gernebern and Hundinc,
and was granted by the Conqueror to William Peverell, by whom
the castle was built. On the forfeiture of William Peverell,
grandson of the first holder, it was granted by Henry II. to
Prince John who, in 1204, made Hugh Nevill governor of the
castle. In 1216 William Ferrers, earl of Derby, took it from
the rebellious barons, and was made governor by Henry III.,
who in 1223 granted a charter for a weekly market at the town.
In 1328 the castle was given to John of Gaunt on his marriage
with Blanche of Lancaster, and thus became parcel of the duchy
of Lancaster. The castle has often been used as a prison, and
from its position was almost impregnable.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASTLETOWN<a name="ar217" id="ar217"></a></span> (Manx, <i>Bully Cashtel</i>), a town of the Isle
of Man, 10 m. S.W. of Douglas, by the Isle of Man railway.
Pop. (1901) 1975. It is picturesquely situated on both sides of
a small harbour formed by the outflow of the Silver Burn into
Castletown Bay. It was the legal capital of the island until
1862. In the centre of the town stands Castle Rushen, which
is said to owe its foundation to the Danish chief, Guthred, in
947-960, though the existing building, which is remarkably well
preserved, probably dates from the 14th century. Until the
18th century it was the residence of the lords of Man, and until
1891 served as a prison. The massive keep is square, and is
surrounded by an outer wall, with towers and a moat. The
council chamber and court-house were built in 1644. In the
neighbourhood of the castle is the old House of Keys, where the
members of the Manx parliament held their sessions until the
removal of the seat of government to Douglas. A lofty Doric
column commemorates Cornelius Smelt, lieutenant-governor
of the island (d. 1832), near which there is a remarkable sun-dial
with thirteen faces, dating from 1720. King William&rsquo;s College,
situated a mile to the north-east of the town, was opened in
1833; but a complete restoration was rendered necessary by
fire in 1844, and it was subsequently enlarged. It is the chief
educational establishment in the island. At Hango Hill near
the town William Christian, receiver-general, who had surrendered
the castle, and with it the island, to the parliamentary
forces in 1651, was executed in 1663 at the instance of the
countess of Derby, who had undertaken to defend it for the
king. A small shipping trade is maintained.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASTOR<a name="ar218" id="ar218"></a></span> and <span class="bold">POLLUX</span> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="Poludeukês">&#928;&#959;&#955;&#965;&#948;&#949;&#973;&#954;&#951;&#962;</span>), in Greek and
Roman mythology, the twin sons of Leda, and brothers of Helen
and Clytaemnestra. They were also known under the name
of Dioscuri (<span class="grk" title="Dioskoroi">&#916;&#953;&#972;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#961;&#959;&#953;</span>, later <span class="grk" title="Dioskouroi">&#916;&#953;&#972;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#953;</span>, children of Zeus), for,
according to later tradition, they were the children of Zeus and
Leda, whose love the god had won under the form of a swan.
In some versions Leda is represented as having brought forth
two eggs, from one of which were born Castor and Pollux, from
the other Helen. In another account, Zeus is the father of
Pollux and Helen, Tyndareus (king of Sparta) of Castor and
Clytaemnestra. In Homer, Castor, Pollux and Clytaemnestra
are said to be the children of Tyndareus and Leda, Helen the
daughter of Leda by Zeus. The Dioscuri were specially reverenced
among people of Dorian race, and were said to have
reigned at Sparta, where also they were buried. They were
also worshipped, especially in Athens, as lords and protectors
(<span class="grk" title="anakes, anaktes">&#7940;&#957;&#945;&#954;&#949;&#962;, &#7940;&#957;&#945;&#954;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span>). Sailors in a storm prayed to them (Horace,
<i>Odes</i>, i. 3) and sacrificed a white lamb, whereupon they were
wont to appear in the form of fire at the masthead (probably
referring to the phenomenon of St Elmo&rsquo;s fire), and the storm
ceased. Later, they were confounded with the Samothracian
Cabeiri. In battle they appeared riding on white horses and
gave victory to the side they favoured. They were the patrons
of hospitality, and founded the sacred festival called Theoxenia.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page482" id="page482"></a>482</span>
They presided over public games, Castor especially as the horse-tamer,
Pollux as the boxer; but both are represented as riding
on horseback or driving in a chariot. In Sparta their ancient
symbol was two parallel beams <span class="grk" title="dokana">&#948;&#972;&#954;&#945;&#957;&#945;</span> connected by cross-bars,
which the Spartans took with them into the field (Plutarch, <i>De
Fraterno Amore</i>, 1; Herodotus v. 75); later, they were represented
by two amphorae with snakes twined round them.
Their most important exploits were the invasion of Attica, to
rescue their sister Helen from Theseus; their share in the hunting
of the Calydonian boar (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Meleager</a></span>) and the Argonautic
expedition, and their battle with the sons of Aphareus, brought
about by a quarrel in regard to some cattle, in which Castor,
the mortal (as the son of Tyndareus), fell by the hand of Idas.
Pollux, finding him dead after the battle, implored Zeus to be
allowed to die with him; this being impossible by reason of his
immortality, Pollux was permitted to spend alternately one day
among the gods, the other in Hades with his brother. According
to another fable, the god marked his approval of their love
by placing them together in the sky, as the Twins or the morning
and evening star (Hyginus, <i>Poet. Astronom.</i> ii. 22). Like the
Asvins of the <i>Veda</i>, the bringers of light in the morning sky,
with whom they have been identified, the Dioscuri are represented
as youthful horsemen, naked or wearing only a light
chlamys. Their characteristic attribute is a pointed egg-shaped
cap, surmounted by a star.</p>

<p>Though their worship was perhaps most carefully observed
among people of Dorian origin, Castor and Pollux were held
in no small veneration at Rome. It was the popular belief in
that city from an early period that the battle of Lake Regillus
had been decided by their interposition (Dion. Halic. vi. 13).
They had fought, it was said, armed and mounted, at the head
of the legions of the commonwealth, and had afterwards carried
the news of the victory with incredible speed to the city. The
well in the Forum at which they alighted was pointed out, and
near it rose their ancient temple, in which the senate often held
its sittings. On the 15th of July, the supposed anniversary of
the battle, a great festival with sumptuous sacrifices was celebrated
in their honour, and a solemn parade of the Roman
knights (<i>transvectio equitum</i>), who looked upon the Dioscuri as
their patrons, took place. (Apollodorus iii. 10. 7, 11. 2; Homer,
<i>Odyssey</i>, xi. 299; Hyginus, <i>Fab.</i> 77. 155; Pindar, <i>Nem.</i> x. 60,
80 and schol.; Diod. Sic. iv. 43; Plutarch, <i>Theseus</i>, 32, 33;

<p><span class="bold">CASTOR OIL,<a name="ar219" id="ar219"></a></span> the fixed oil obtained from the seeds of the
castor oil plant or Palma Christi, <i>Ricinus communis</i>, belonging
to the natural order Euphorbiaceae. The botanical name is
from Lat. <i>ricinus</i>, a tick, from the form and markings of the seed.
The plant is a native of tropical Africa, but it has been introduced,
and is now cultivated in most tropical and in the warmer
temperate countries. In size it varies from a shrubby plant to a
tree of from 30 to 40 ft. in height according to the climate in
which it grows, being arborescent in tropical latitudes. On
account of its very large beautiful palmate-peltate leaves, which
sometimes measure as much as 2 ft. in diameter, it is cultivated
as an ornamental plant. In the south of England, with the habit
of an annual, it ripens its seeds in favourable seasons; and it has
been known to come to maturity as far north as Christiania in
Norway. Plants are readily grown from seed, which should be
sown singly in small pots and placed in heat early in March. The
young plants are kept under glass till early in June when they
are hardened and put out. The fruit consists of a three-celled
capsule, covered externally with soft yielding prickles, and each
cell develops a single seed. The seeds of the different cultivated
varieties, of which there are a great number, differ much in size
and in external markings; but average seeds are of an oval
laterally compressed form, with their longest diameter about
four lines. They have a shining, marble-grey and brown, thick,
leathery outer coat, within which is a thin dark-coloured brittle
coat. A large distinct leafy embryo lies in the middle of a dense,
oily tissue (endosperm). The seeds contain a toxic substance,
which makes them actively poisonous; so much so that three
have been known to kill an adult.</p>

<p>The oil is obtained from the seeds by two principal methods&mdash;expression
and decoction&mdash;the latter process being largely used
in India, where the oil, on account of its cheapness and abundance
is extensively employed for illuminating as well as for other
domestic and medicinal purposes. The oil exported from
Calcutta to Europe is prepared by shelling and crushing the
seeds between rollers. The crushed mass is then placed in hempen
cloths and pressed in a screw or hydraulic press. The oil which
exudes is mixed with water and heated till the water boils, and
the mucilaginous matter in the oil separates as a scum. It is
next strained, then bleached in the sunlight, and stored for
exportation. A considerable quantity of castor oil of an excellent
quality is also made in Italy; and in California the manufacture
is conducted on an extensive scale. The following is an outline
of the process adopted in a Californian factory. The seeds are
submitted to a dry heat in a furnace for an hour or thereby, by
which they are softened and prepared to part easily with their oil.
They are then pressed in a large powerful screw-press, and the
oily matter which flows out is caught, mixed with an equal
proportion of water, and boiled to purify it from mucilaginous
and albuminous matter. After boiling about an hour, it is
allowed to cool, the water is drawn off, and the oil is transferred
to zinc tanks or clarifiers capable of holding from 60 to 100
gallons. In these it stands about eight hours, bleaching in the
sun, after which it is ready for storing. By this method 100 &#8468;
of good seeds yield about 5 gallons of pure oil.</p>

<p>Castor oil is a viscid liquid, almost colourless when pure,
possessing only a slight odour, and a mild yet highly nauseous
and disagreeable taste. Its specific gravity is .96, a little less
than that of water, and it dissolves freely in alcohol, ether and
glacial acetic acid. It contains palmitic and several other fatty
acids, among which there is one&mdash;ricinoleic acid&mdash;peculiar to
itself. This occurs in combination with glycerin, constituting
the greater part of the bulk of the oil.</p>

<p>The active principle to which the oil owes its purgative
properties has not been isolated. It is, indeed, probable that it
is formed in the intestine, as a result of some decomposition as
yet unknown. The dose is from a drachm to an ounce. The
pharmacopoeial mixture is best avoided, being almost uniquely
nauseous. By far the best way to administer the oil is in capsules.
It acts in about five hours, affecting the entire length of the bowel,
but not increasing the flow of bile except in very large doses.
The mode of its action is unknown. The oil will purge when
rubbed into the skin or injected <i>per rectum</i>. It is an invaluable
drug in temporary constipation and whenever a mild action is
essential, as in pregnancy. It is extremely useful for children
and the aged, but must not be employed in cases of chronic
constipation, which it only aggravates, whilst relieving the
symptoms.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASTRÉN, MATTHIAS ALEXANDER<a name="ar220" id="ar220"></a></span> (1813-1853), Finnish
ethnologist and philologist, was born at Tervola, in the parish of
Kemi in Finland, on the 20th of November (December 2, 1813).
His father, Christian Castrén, parish minister at Rovaniemi,
died in 1825; and Matthias passed under the protection of
his uncle, Mathias Castrén, the kindly and learned incumbent of
Kemi. At the age of twelve he was sent to school at Uleåborg,
and there he helped to maintain himself by teaching the younger
children. On his removal to the Alexander University at
Helsingfors in 1830, he first devoted himself to Greek and Hebrew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page483" id="page483"></a>483</span>
with the intention of entering the church; but his interest was
soon excited by the language of his native country, and he even
began before his course was completed to lay the foundations of a
work on Finnish mythology. The necessity of personal explorations
among the still unwritten languages of cognate tribes soon
made itself evident; and in 1838 he joined a medical fellow-student,
Dr. Ehrstrom, in a journey through Lapland. In the
following year he travelled in Russian Karelia at the expense of
the Literary Society of Finland; and in 1841 he undertook, in
company with Dr Elias Lonnrot, the great Finnish philologist, a
third journey, which ultimately extended beyond the Ural as far
as Obdorsk, and occupied a period of three years. Before starting
on this last expedition he had published a translation into
Swedish of the Finnish epic of <i>Kalevala</i>; and on his return he
gave to the world his <i>Elementa grammatices Syrjaenae</i> and
<i>Elementa grammatices Tscheremissae</i>, 1844. No sooner had he
recovered from the illness which his last journey had occasioned
than he set out, under the auspices of the Academy of St Petersburg
and the Helsingfors University, on an exploration of the
whole government of Siberia, which resulted in a vast addition
to previous knowledge, but seriously affected the health of the
adventurous investigator. The first-fruits of his collections
were published at St Petersburg in 1849 in the form of a <i>Versuch
einer ostjakischen Sprachlehre</i>. In 1850 he published a treatise
<i>De affixis personalibus linguarum Altaicarum</i>, and was appointed
professor at Helsingfors of the new chair of Finnish language and
literature. The following year saw him raised to the rank of
chancellor of the university; and he was busily engaged in what
he regarded as his principal work, a Samoyedic grammar, when
he died on the 7th of May 1853.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Five volumes of his collected works appeared from 1852 to 1858,

<p><span class="bold">CASTRENSIS, PAULUS,<a name="ar221" id="ar221"></a></span> an Italian jurist of the 14th century.
He studied under Baldus at Perugia, and was a fellow-pupil
with Cardinal Zabarella. He was admitted to the degree of
doctor of civil law in the university of Avignon, but it is uncertain
when he first undertook the duties of a professor. A tradition,
which has been handed down by Panzirolus, represents him as
having taught law for a period of fifty-seven years. He was
professor at Vienna in 1390, at Avignon in 1394, and at Padua
in 1429; and, at different periods, at Florence, at Bologna and at
Perugia. He was for some time the vicar-general of Cardinal
Zabarella at Florence, and his eminence as a teacher of canon
law may be inferred from the language of one of his pupils, who
styles him &ldquo;famosissimus juris utriusque monarca.&rdquo; His most
complete treatise is his readings on the <i>Digest</i>, and it appears from
a passage in his readings on the <i>Digestum Vetus</i> that he delivered
them at a time when he had been actively engaged for forty-five
years as a teacher of civil law. His death is generally assigned
to 1436, but it appears from an entry in a MS. of the <i>Digestum
Vetus</i>, which is extant at Munich, made by the hand of one of
his pupils who styles him &ldquo;praeceptor meus,&rdquo; that he died on
the 20th of July 1441.</p>

Albi on a branch line of the Southern railway. Pop. (1906)
town, 19,864; commune, 28,272. Castres, the busiest and most
populous town of its department, is intersected from north to
south by the Agout; the river is fringed by old houses the
upper stories of which project over its waters. Wide boulevards
traverse the west of the town, which is also rendered attractive
by numerous fountains fed by a fine aqueduct hewn in the rock.
The church of St Benoît, once a cathedral, and the most important
of the churches of Castres, dates only from the 17th and
18th centuries. The hôtel de ville, which contains a museum
and the municipal library, occupies the former bishop&rsquo;s palace,
designed by Jules Mansart in the 17th century; the Romanesque
tower beside it is the only survival of an old Benedictine abbey.
The town possesses some old mansions of which the hôtel de
Nayrac, of the Renaissance, is of most interest. Castres has a
sub-prefecture, tribunals of first instance and of commerce,
a board of trade-arbitrators, a chamber of commerce, a branch
of the bank of France and two hospitals. There are also
communal colleges for boys and girls, a school of artillery
and school of draughtsmanship. The industrial establishments
include manufactories of earthenware and porcelain and metal-foundries,
and tanning, leather-dressing, turnery, the making
of wooden shoes and furniture, the weaving of woollen and other
fabrics, dyeing, and the manufacture of machinery, paper and
parchment are carried on.</p>

<p>Castres grew up round a Benedictine abbey, which is believed
to have been founded in the 7th century. It was a place of considerable
importance as early as the 12th century, and ranked
as the second town of the Albigenses. During the Albigensian
crusade it surrendered of its own accord to Simon de Montfort;
and in 1356 it was raised to a countship by King John of France.
On the confiscation of the possessions of the D&rsquo;Armagnac family,
to which it had passed, it was bestowed by Louis XI. on Boffilo
del Giudice, but the appointment led to so much disagreement
that the countship was united to the crown by Francis I. in 1519.
In the wars of the latter part of the 16th century the inhabitants
sided with the Protestant party, fortified the town, and established
an independent republic. They were brought to terms,
however, by Louis XIII., and forced to dismantle their fortifications;
and the town was made the seat of the <i>chambre de l&rsquo;édit</i>,
or chamber for the investigation of the affairs of the Protestants,
afterwards transferred to Castelnaudary (in 1679). The bishopric
of Castres, which had been established by Pope John XXII. in
1317, was abolished at the Revolution.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASTRO, INEZ DE<a name="ar223" id="ar223"></a></span> (d. 1355), mistress, and perhaps wife, of
Peter I. (Pedro), king of Portugal, called <i>Collo de Garza</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
&ldquo;Heron&rsquo;s Neck,&rdquo; was born in Spanish Galicia, in the earlier years
of the 14th century. Tradition asserts that her father, Don
Pedro Fernandez de Castro, and her mother, Dona Aldonça
Soares de Villadares, a noble Portuguese lady, were unmarried,
and that Inez and her two brothers were consequently of bastard
birth. Educated at the semi-Oriental provincial court of Juan
Manuel, duke of Peñafiel, Inez grew up side by side with Costança,
the duke&rsquo;s daughter by a scion of the royal house of Aragon,
and her own cousin. After refusing several crowned heads
in marriage, Costança was at last persuaded to accept the hand
of the infante Dom Pedro, son of Alphonso the Proud, king of
Portugal. In 1341 the two girls left Peñafiel; Costança&rsquo;s marriage
was celebrated in the same year, and the young infanta and
her cousin went to reside at Lisbon, or at Coimbra, where Dom
Pedro conceived that luckless and furious passion for Inez which
has immortalized them.</p>

<p>The morality of the age was lax, and more especially so in
Spain and Portugal, where the looseness of the marriage tie
and the example of the Moors encouraged polygamy. Pedro&rsquo;s
connexion <i>par amours</i> with Inez would of itself have aroused
no opposition. He might even have married her, after the death
of his wife in childbirth in 1345. According to his own assurance
he did marry her in 1354. But by that time the rising power
of the Castro family had created the most brutal hatred among
their rivals, both in Spain and Portugal. Alvaro Gonzales,
Pedro Coelho, and Diogo Lopes Pacheco persuaded the king,
Alphonso, that his throne was in danger from an alliance between
his son and the Castros, and with all the brutality of the age
they urged the king to remove the danger by murdering the poor
woman. The old king listened, refused, wavered and ended by
yielding. He went in secret to the palace at Coimbra, where
Inez and the infante resided, accompanied by his three familiars,
and by others who agreed with them. The beauty and tears
of Inez disarmed his resolution, and he turned to leave her;
but the gentlemen about him had gone too far to recede. Inez
was stabbed to death and was buried immediately in the church
of Santa Clara.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page484" id="page484"></a>484</span></p>

<p>The infante raised at once the flag of revolt against his father,
and was only appeased by the concession of a large share in the
government. The three murderers of Inez were sent out of the
kingdom by Alphonso, who knew his son too well not to be aware
that the vengeance would be tremendous as the crime. They
took refuge in Castile. In 1357, however, Alphonso died, and
the infante was crowned king of Portugal. Peter the Cruel, his
nephew, reigned over Castile; and the murderers were given
up as soon as required. Diogo Lopes escaped through the gratitude
of a beggar to whom he had formerly done a kindness;
but Coelho and Gonzales were executed, with horrible tortures,
in the very presence of the king.</p>

<p>The story of the exhumation and coronation of the corpse
of Inez has often been told. It is said that to the dead body,
crowned and robed in royal raiment, and enthroned beside the
king, the assembled nobles of Portugal paid homage as to their
queen, swearing fealty on the withered hand of the corpse. The
gravest doubts, however, exist as to the authenticity of this
story; Fernão Lopes, the Portuguese Froissart, who is the great
authority for the details of the death of Inez, with some of the
actors in which he was acquainted, says nothing of the ghastly
ceremony, though he tells at length the tale of the funeral honours
that the king bestowed upon his wife. Inez was buried at Alcobaça
with extraordinary magnificence, in a tomb of white marble,
surmounted by her crowned statue; and near her sepulchre
Pedro caused his own to be placed. The monument, after repeatedly
resisting the violence of curiosity, was broken into
in 1810 by the French soldiery; the statue was mutilated, and
the yellow hair was cut from the broken skeleton, to be preserved
in reliquaries and blown away by the wind. The children of
Inez shared her habit of misfortune. From her brother, however,
Alvaro Perez de Castro, the reigning house of Portugal directly
descends.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASTRO, JOÃO DE<a name="ar224" id="ar224"></a></span> (1500-1548), called by Camoens <i>Castro
Forte</i>, fourth viceroy of the Portuguese Indies, was the son of
Alvaro de Castro, civil governor of Lisbon. A younger son, and
destined therefore for the church, he became at an early age a
brilliant humanist, and studied mathematics under Pedro
Nunez, in company with the infante Dom Luis, son of Emanuel
the First, with whom he contracted a life-long friendship. At
eighteen he went to Tangier, where he was dubbed knight by
Duarte de Menezes the governor, and there he remained several
years. In 1535 he accompanied Dom Luis to the siege of Tunis,
where he had the honour of refusing knighthood and reward at
the hands of the great emperor Charles V. Returning to Lisbon,
he received from the king the small commandership of São
Pablo de Salvaterra in 1538. He was exceedingly poor, but his
wife Lenor de Coutinho, a noble Portuguese lady, admired and
appreciated her husband sufficiently to make light of their
poverty. Soon after this he left for the Indies in company with
his uncle Garcia de Noronha, and on his arrival at Goa enlisted
among the <i>aventureiros</i>, &ldquo;the bravest of the brave,&rdquo; told off
for the relief of Diu. In 1540 he served on an expedition under
Estevão da Gama, by whom his son, Alvaro de Castro, a child
of thirteen, was knighted, out of compliment to him. Returning
to Portugal, João de Castro was named commander of a fleet,
in 1543, to clear the European seas of pirates; and in 1545 he
was sent, with six sail, to the Indies, in the room of Martin de
Sousa, who had been dismissed the viceroyalty. The next three
years were the hardest and most brilliant, as they were the last,
of his life&mdash;years of battle and struggle, of glory and sorrow, of
suffering and triumph. Valiantly seconded by his sons (one
of whom, Fernão, was killed before Diu) and by João Mascarenhas,
João de Castro achieved such popularity by the overthrow
of Mahmud, king of Gujarat, by the relief of Diu,
and by the defeat of the great army of the Adil Khan, that
he could contract a very large loan with the Goa merchants on
the simple security of his moustache. These great deeds were
followed by the capture of Broach, by the complete subjugation
of Malacca, and by the passage of Antonio Moniz into Ceylon;
and in 1547 the great captain was appointed viceroy by João III.,
who had at last accepted him without mistrust. He did not live
long to fill this charge, expiring in the arms of his friend, St
Francis Xavier, on the 6th of June 1548. He was buried at Goa,
but his remains were afterwards exhumed and conveyed to
Portugal, to be reinterred under a splendid monument in the
convent of Bemfica.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASTROGIOVANNI<a name="ar225" id="ar225"></a></span> (Arab. <i>Kasr-Yani</i>, a corruption of
<i>Castrum Ennae</i>), a town and episcopal see of the province of
Caltanisetta, Sicily, 95 m. by rail S.E. of Palermo, and 56 m. W.
of Catania, situated 2605 ft. above sea-level, almost in the centre
of the island, and commanding a magnificent view of the interior.
Pop. (1901) 25,826. Enna was one of the cities of the Sicels, and
the statement of Stephanus Byzantinus that it was colonized
by Syracuse in 664 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> is improbable. The question is discussed
by E. Pais, <i>Atakta</i> (Pisa, 1891), 63. It does not appear
in history before the time of Dionysius I. of Syracuse, who,
after unsuccessful attempts, finally acquired possession of it by
treachery about 397 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> Its natural position rendered it a
fortress of great importance, and it is frequently mentioned in
subsequent history. In 134-132 it was the headquarters of the
slave revolt, and was only reduced by treachery. Cicero speaks
of it as a place of some importance, but in imperial times it
seems to have been of little account. In <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 837 the Saracens
attempted to take it, but without success; and it was again
only by treachery that they were able to take it in 859. In
1087 it fell into the hands of the Normans; and the existing
remains of fortifications are entirely medieval. There are
indeed no remains of earlier days. The cathedral, founded in
1307, is of some interest. There are no remains of the famous
temple of Demeter, from which Verres, as Cicero tells us, removed
the bronze statue of the goddess. The lake of Pergus,
where Persephone, according to one of the myths, was carried
off by Hades, lies 4 m. to the south. The myth itself must have
had some local origin, but has had so much Greek detail grafted
upon it that the very names of the earlier Sicel deities have
been displaced.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASTRO URDIALES,<a name="ar226" id="ar226"></a></span> a seaport of northern Spain, in the
province of Santander, situated on the bay of Biscay and at
the head of a branch railway connected with the Bilbao-Santander
line. Pop. (1870) about 3500; (1900) 14,191. Castro
Urdiales is a modern town, although its castle and parish church
date from the middle ages. It was destroyed by the French in
1813, but speedily rebuilt and fortified. Its rapid rise in population
and prosperity dates from the increased development
of iron-mining and railway communication which took place
after 1879. Its chief industries are iron-mining, fishing, and the
preservation of fish, especially sardines, in oil. Between 1894
and 1904 the exports of iron ore rose from 277,200 tons to
516,574 tons.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASTRO Y BELLVIS, GUILLÉN DE<a name="ar227" id="ar227"></a></span> (1569-1631), Spanish
dramatist, was a Valencian by birth, and early enjoyed a reputation
as a man of letters. In 1591 he became a member
of a local literary academy called the <i>Nocturnos</i>. At one time a
captain of the coast-guard, at another the protégé of Benavente,
viceroy of Naples, who appointed him governor of Scigliano,
patronized by Osuna and Olivares, Castro was nominated a
knight of the order of Santiago in 1623. He settled at Madrid
in 1626, and died there on the 28th of July 1631 in such poverty
that his funeral expenses were defrayed by charity. He probably
made the acquaintance of Lope de Vega at the festivals
(1620-1622) held to commemorate the beatification and canonization
of St Isidore, the patron saint of Madrid. On the latter
occasion Castro&rsquo;s <i>octavas</i> were awarded the first prize. Lope de
Vega dedicated to him a celebrated play entitled <i>Las Almenas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page485" id="page485"></a>485</span>
de Toro</i> (1619), and when Castro&rsquo;s <i>Comedias</i> were published in
1618-1621 he dedicated the first volume to Lope de Vega&rsquo;s
daughter. The drama that has made Castro&rsquo;s reputation is
<i>Las Mocedades del Cid</i> (1599?), to the first part of which Corneille
was largely indebted for the materials of his tragedy. The two
parts of this play, like all those by Castro, have the genuine
ring of the old <i>romances</i>; and, from their intense nationality,
no less than for their primitive poetry and flowing versification,
were among the most popular pieces of their day. Castro&rsquo;s
<i>Fuerza de la costumbre</i> is the source of <i>Love&rsquo;s Care</i>, a play ascribed
to Fletcher. He is also the reputed author of <i>El Prodigio
de los Montes</i>, from which Calderón derived <i>El Mágico prodigioso</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI DEGLI ANTELMINELLI<a name="ar228" id="ar228"></a></span> (1281-1328),
duke of Lucca, was by birth a Lucchese, and by descent
and training a Ghibelline. Being exiled at an early age with
his parents and others of their faction by the Guelphs, then in
the ascendant, and orphaned at nineteen, he served as a <i>condottiere</i>
under Philip IV. of France in Flanders, later with the
Visconti in Lombardy, and in 1313 under the Ghibelline chief,
Uguccione della Faggiuola, lord of Pisa, in central Italy. He
assisted Uguccione in many enterprises, including the capture
of Lucca (1314) and the victory over the Florentines at Montecatini
(1315). An insurrection of the Lucchese having led to
the expulsion of Uguccione and his party, Castruccio regained
his freedom and his position, and the Ghibelline triumph was
presently assured. Elected lord of Lucca in 1316, he warred
incessantly against the Florentines, and was at first the faithful
adviser and stanch supporter of Frederick of Austria, who made
him imperial vicar of Lucca in 1320. After the battle of
Mühlbach he went over to the emperor Louis the Bavarian,
whom he served for many years. In 1325 he defeated the
Florentines at Altopascio, and was appointed by the emperor
duke of Lucca, Pistoja, Volterra and Luni, and two years later
he captured Pisa, of which he was made imperial vicar. But,
subsequently, his relations with Louis seem to have grown less
friendly and he was afterwards excommunicated by the papal
legate in the interests of the Guelphs. At his death in 1328 the
fortunes of his young children were wrecked in the Guelphic
triumph.</p>

ancient temple of Minerva, said to have been founded by Idomeneus,
who formed the tribe of the Sallentini from a mixture
of Cretans, Illyrians and Italian Locrians. It is also said to have

<p><span class="bold">CASUARINA,<a name="ar230" id="ar230"></a></span> a genus of trees containing about 30 species,
chiefly Australian, but a few Indo-Malayan. The long whip-like
green branches are longitudinally grooved, and bear at the nodes
whorls of small scale-leaves, the shoots resembling those of
<i>Equisetum</i> (horse-tail). The flowers are unisexual; the staminate
are borne in spikes, each flower consisting of a central stamen
which is surrounded by two scale-like perianth-leaves. The
pistillate are borne in dense spherical heads; each flower stands
in the axil of a bract and consists of two united carpels flanked
by a pair of bracteoles; the long styles hang out beyond the
bracts, and the one-chambered ovary contains two ovules.
In the fruit the bracteoles form two woody valves between
which is a nut; the aggregate of fruits resemble small cones.
Pollen is transferred by the wind to the long styles. The pollen-tube
does not penetrate the ovule through the micropyle but
enters at the opposite end&mdash;the chalaza. This anomaly was
discovered by Dr M. Treub (see <i>Annal. Jardin Botan. Buitenzorg</i>,
x. 1891), and is associated with a peculiar development of the
ovule, and an increased number and peculiar form of the embryo-sacs
(nacrospores). Treub proposed to separate <i>Casuarina</i>
as a distinct group of Angiosperms, and suggested the following
arrangement:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">The names of the two subdivisions recall the manner of entrance
of the pollen-tube. More recent investigations, chiefly by
Nawaschin and Miss Benson, on members of the orders Betulaceae,
Fagaceae, Juglans and Ulmus, showed a recurrence
in a greater or less degree of the various anomalies previously
observed in <i>Casuarina</i>, and suggest that the affinity of <i>Casuarina</i>
is with these orders of Dicotyledons.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CASUISTRY<a name="ar231" id="ar231"></a></span> (from the Lat. <i>casus</i>, a point of law), the art of
bringing general moral principles to bear on particular actions.
It is, in short, applied morality; anybody is a casuist who
reflects about his duties and tries to bring them into line with
some intelligible moral standard. But morality at different
times has worn very different dresses. It has sometimes been
thought of as an outward law, sometimes as an inward disposition;
and each of these rival conceptions has developed a
casuistical method of its own. Believers in law have put their
trust in authority or logic; while believers in disposition chiefly
look to our instinctive faculties&mdash;conscience, common-sense or
sentiment. The legal is the older group, and to it the name of
casuist is often exclusively reserved, generally with the implication
that its methods are too purely technical to commend
themselves to mankind at large. But common-sense and conscience
are quite as definite guides as logic or authority; and
there seems no good reason for refusing to give the name of
casuistry to their operations.</p>

<p>The casuistry of primitive man is uncompromisingly legal.
His morality is not yet separated from his religion; and religion
for him means the cult of some superior being&mdash;the king or priest
of his tribe&mdash;whose person is charged with a kind of sacred
electricity. &ldquo;His divinity is a fire, which, under proper restraints,
confers endless blessings; but if rashly touched, or allowed
to break bounds, it burns or destroys what it touches. Hence
the disastrous effects supposed to follow a breach of taboo;
the offender has thrust his hand into the divine fire, which shrivels
up and consumes him on the spot&rdquo; (Frazer, <i>The Golden Bough</i>,
i. 169). Elaborate rules are accordingly drawn up to secure
the maximum of benefit, and the minimum of inconvenience,
from this sacred fire; and in the application of these rules does
savage casuistry consist. At a higher stage of civilization the
god is no longer present in person but issues to his worshippers
categorical commands. These logic must seize upon and develop
as far as they will go; for the breach of some trifling consequence
of a rule might mean the loss of the deity&rsquo;s favour. Hence the
rise of sacred books among most Eastern peoples. On the
Jewish Decalogue, for instance, follows the law, and on the law
the rabbinical schools. Some of these will be stricter, and some
laxer; but on the whole all tend to &ldquo;aggravate&rdquo; the law&mdash;down
to the point of forbidding the faithful to wear a girdle,
or to kill a noxious insect on the Sabbath. Though indeed
we might look nearer home than the Talmud for similar absurdities;
most Puritan communities could furnish strange freaks
of Sabbatarian casuistry. Nor have the Catholics been one
whit behind them. Their scholastic doctors gravely discuss
whether&mdash;since water is the &ldquo;matter&rdquo; of baptism&mdash;a soul
can be made regenerate by milk, or rose-water or wine.</p>

<p>At the opposite pole stood ancient Greece. Here ceremonial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page486" id="page486"></a>486</span>
casuistry found no place, because there were no sacred books.
&ldquo;Among the Greeks writing never attained the consecration of
religion. No system of doctrine and observance, no manuals
containing authoritative rules of morality, were ever transmitted
in documentary form. In conduct they shrank from formulae.
Unvarying rules petrified action; the need of flexibility, of
perpetual adjustment, was strongly felt&rdquo; (Butcher, <i>The Greek
Genius</i>, p. 182). For this reason their interest in ethical speculations
was all the keener; their great thinkers were endlessly
engaged in settling what the relation ought to be between duty
and self-interest. Ought one to swallow up the other&mdash;and, if
so, which should prevail? Or was it possible to patch up a
compromise between them? The great Stoic philosophers
took the austerest line, and held that duty should always and
everywhere be our only law. But it was one thing to enunciate
such magnificent theories in a lecture, and quite another to
apply them in the market-place. Casuistry came to the aid of
average human nature&mdash;that is to say, pupils began to confront
the master with hard cases taken from daily life. And more
than one master was disposed to make large&mdash;even startlingly
large&mdash;concessions to the exigencies of practice. This concrete
side of moral philosophy came specially into evidence when
Stoicism was transplanted to Rome. Cicero&rsquo;s <i>De Officiis</i> abounds
in the kind of question afterwards so warmly discussed by Dr
Johnson and his friends. Is it ever right to tell a lie? May a
lawyer defend a client whom he knows to be guilty? In selling
my goods, is it enough not to disguise their shortcomings, or
ought I candidly to admit them? Seneca even made the
discussion of such problems into a regular discipline, claiming
that their concrete character gave an interest in morality to
those who had no love for abstractions; while they prevented
those who had from losing themselves in the clouds. And M.
Thamin maintains that, if his heroes did not form great characters,
at any rate they taught the Roman child to train its conscience.
But, then, Cicero and Seneca took common-sense as their guide.
They decided each problem on its merits, looking more to the
spirit than to the letter, and often showing a practical sagacity
worthy of Johnson himself. Quite in the great doctor&rsquo;s spirit is
Cicero&rsquo;s counsel to his son, to hear what the philosophers had
to say, but to decide for himself as a man of the world. Such
advice could not be grateful to the philosophers themselves&mdash;then
a definite professional class, not unlike the &ldquo;spiritual
directors&rdquo; of a later Rome, who earned their bread by smoothing
away the doubts of the scrupulous on all matters intellectual
and moral. Their great weapon was their logic; and a logician,
as Pascal says, must be very unfortunate or very stupid if he
cannot manage to find exceptions to every conceivable rule.
In their hands casuistry became the art of finding such exceptions.
From the Greek sophists they borrowed ingenious ways of
playing off one duty against another, or duty in general against
self-interest&mdash;leaving the doubter in the alternative of neglecting
the one and being a knave, or neglecting the other and being a
fool. Or else they raised a subtle distinction between the act
and the intention. To get drunk for the sake of the drink was
the mark of a beast; but wine was a powerful stimulant to the
brain, and to fuddle oneself in order to think great thoughts was
worthy of a sage. No doubt these airy paradoxes were not
always seriously taken; but it is significant that a common
Roman proverb identified &ldquo;philosophizing&rdquo; (<i>philosophatur</i>)
with thinking out some dirty trick.</p>

<p>Christianity swept the whole discussion on to a higher plane.
All the stress now fell on the disposition, not on the outward act.
The good deeds of a just man were a natural consequence of his
justice; whereas a bad man was no whit the better, because he
now and then deviated into doing right. Actions, in short,
were of no account whatever, apart from the character that
produced them. &ldquo;All things are lawful unto me,&rdquo; said St Paul,
&ldquo;but all are not expedient.&rdquo; And St Augustine sums the
whole matter up in the famous phrase: &ldquo;Have charity, and do
as thou wilt.&rdquo; Narrow-minded Christian consciences, however,
could not stay long on this level; law was so very much more
satisfying a guide than vague, elusive charity. And law in
plenty was forthcoming, so soon as the Church developed the
discipline of public confessions followed by appropriate penances
for each fault. At first the whole proceeding was informal and
impulsive enough; but by the 7th century it had grown
thoroughly stereotyped and formal. <i>Libri Poenitentiales</i> began
to appear&mdash;detailed lists of all possible sins, with the forfeit to
be exacted from each. As public penance finally decayed, and
auricular confession took its place, these were superseded by
the <i>Summae de Poenitentia</i>,&mdash;law-books in the strictest sense.
These were huge digests of all that popes, councils, primitive
fathers had decided on every kind of question pertaining to the
confessional&mdash;what exactly is a sin, what kind of questions the
priests must ask, under what conditions he could give absolution.
As such, they were eagerly welcomed by the clergy; for a single
magistrate, sitting in secret without appeal, necessarily grasps
at whatever will lighten his burden of responsibility. Nor was
their complexity a stumbling-block. The medieval mind was
only too prone to look on morality as a highly technical art,
quite as difficult as medicine or chancery law&mdash;a path where
wayfaring men were certain to err, with no guide but their
unsophisticated conscience. What could they possibly do but
cling to their priest with a &ldquo;blind and unexpressed faith&rdquo;?</p>

<p>Against this state of things the Reformation was a violent
protest. Catholicism increasingly took for granted that a man
imperilled his soul by thinking for himself; Protestantism
replied that he could certainly lose it, if he left his thinking to
another. For it is to the individual conscience that God speaks;
through the struggles of the individual conscience He builds up
a strong and stable Christian character. &ldquo;A man may be a
heretic in the truth,&rdquo; says Milton in his <i>Areopagitica</i> (1644),
&ldquo;if he believes things only because his pastor says so, or the
Assembly so determines, without knowing other reason, though
his belief be true, yet the very truth he holds becomes his heresy.
There is not any burden that some would not gladlier post off
to another than the charge and care of their religion. A wealthy
man, addicted to his pleasures and his profits, finds religion to be
a traffic so entangled, and of so many piddling accounts, that
of all mysteries he cannot skill to keep a stock going upon that
trade. What does he therefore but resolve to give over toiling,
and find himself some factor, to whose care and conduct he may
commit the whole managing of his religious affairs&mdash;some divine
of note and estimation that must be. To him he adheres, resigns
the whole warehouse of his religion with all the locks and keys
into his custody, and indeed makes the very person of that man
his religion. So that a man may say his religion is now no more
within himself, but is become a dividual moveable, which goes or
comes near him, according as that good man frequents the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Twelve years after the <i>Areopagitica</i> appeared Pascal&rsquo;s
<i>Provincial Letters</i> (1656-1657). These deal with the casuists
of the Counter-Reformation in the spirit of Milton, laying especial
stress on the artificiality of their methods and the laxity
of their results. Not, of course, that they meant deliberate
evil; Pascal expressly credits them with good intentions. But
they were drawn, almost to a man, from Italy or Spain, the
two countries least alive to the spirit of the Reformation;
and most of them were Jesuits, the order that set out to be
nothing Protestantism was, and everything that Protestantism
was not. Hence they were resolutely opposed to any idea of
reform; for to begin making changes in the Church&rsquo;s system
would be a tacit admission that Luther had some show of
reason on his side. On the other hand, they would certainly
lose their hold on the laity, unless some kind of change were
made; for many of the Church&rsquo;s rules were obsolete, and
others far too severe to impose on the France of Montaigne
or even the Spain of Cervantes. Thus caught between two fires
the casuists developed a highly ingenious method, not unlike
that of the Roman Stoics, for eviscerating the substance of a
rule while leaving its shadow carefully intact. The next step
was to force the confessors to accept their lax interpretation
of the law; and this was accomplished by their famous theory
of <i>probabilism</i>&mdash;first taught in Spain about 1580. This made
it a grave sin in the priest to refuse absolution, whenever there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page487" id="page487"></a>487</span>
was some good reason for giving it even when there were other
and better reasons for refusing it. This principle does not
deserve all the abuse that has been lavished upon it. It secured
uniformity in the confessional, and thereby protected the
penitent from the caprices of individual priests; and by depriving
these of responsibility, it forced the penitent back on
himself. But the gain was more than counterbalanced by the
evil. The less the Church could expect from its penitents, the
more it was driven to trust to the miraculous efficiency of sacramental
grace. Once get a sinner to confession, and the whole
work was done. However bad his natural disposition, the
magical words of absolution would make him a new man. As
for most penitents, all they cared for was to scrape through by
the skin of their teeth. Casuistry might insist that it only
proposed to fix the minimum of a minimum, and beg them for
their soul&rsquo;s sake to aim a little higher. Human nature seldom
resists the charms of a fixed standard&mdash;least of all when it is
applied by a live judge in a visible court. If the priest must be
satisfied with little, why be at the trouble of offering more?
For this reason, probabilism found vigorous opponents in
Bossuet and other eminent divines; and various of its excesses
were condemned by the popes during the latter half of the
17th century. After a long eclipse it was finally re-established,
though in a very modified form, by Alfonso Liguori about the
middle of the 18th century.</p>

<p>In Protestant countries casuistry shrank and dwindled,
though works on the subject continued to be written both in
Germany and England during the 17th century. The best known
of the Anglican books is Jeremy Taylor&rsquo;s <i>Ductor Dubitantium</i>
(1660). But the Protestant casuist never pretended to speak
authoritatively; all he did was to give his reasons, and leave
the decision to the conscience of his readers. &ldquo;In all this
discourse,&rdquo; says Bishop Sanderson, one of the best of the
English writers, &ldquo;I take it upon me not to write edicts, but to
give my advice.&rdquo; Very soon, however, these relics of casuistry
were swept away by the rising tide of common-sense. The
18th century loved to discuss hard cases of conscience, as a
very cursory glance at Fielding&rsquo;s novels (1742-1751) or Boswell&rsquo;s
<i>Life of Johnson</i> (1791) will show. But the age was incurably
suspicious of attempts to deal with such difficulties on any
kind of technical system. Pope was never tired of girding at</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morality by her false guardians drawn,</p>
<p class="i05">Chicane in furs, and casuistry in lawn&rdquo;;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">while Fielding has embodied the popular conception of a casuist
in Parson Thwackum and Philosopher Square, both of whom
only take to argument when they want to reason themselves
out of some obvious duty. Still more outspoken is the Savoyard
vicar in the <i>Émile</i> (1762) of Jean Jacques Rousseau:
&ldquo;Whence do I get my rules of action? I find them in my
heart. All I feel to be good is good; all I feel to be evil is evil.
Conscience is the best of casuists; it is only when men wish
to cheat it that they fly to logical quibbles.&rdquo; Extravagant
as this sentiment sounds, it paved the way to better things.
The great object of 17th-century moralists had been to find
some general principle from which the whole of ethics could be
deduced; common-sense, by turning its back on abstract
principles of every kind, forced the philosophers to come down
to the solid earth, and start by inquiring how the world does
make up its mind in fact. During the last two centuries deduction
has gone steadily out, and psychology come in. Ethics
have become more distinctively a science, instead of an awkward
hybrid between a science and an art; their business has been
to investigate what moral conduct is, not to lay down the law
as to what it ought to be. Hence they deliberately refuse to
engage in casuistry of the old-fashioned sort. Further, it is
increasingly felt that ethical judgments do not depend on
reason alone, but involve every element in our character; and
that the real problem of practical morality is to establish a
harmonious balance between the intelligence and the feelings&mdash;to
make a man&rsquo;s &ldquo;I think this is right&rdquo; correspond with his
&ldquo;I feel that it is so.&rdquo; Whether systematic training can do
anything to make the attainment of this balance easier is a
question that has lately engaged the attention of many educational
reformers; and whatever future casuistry may still have
before it would seem to lie along the lines indicated by them.</p>

<p>There is an excellent study of the ancient casuists by M. Raymond
Thamin, <i>Un Problème moral dans l&rsquo;antiquité</i> (Paris, 1884). For the
Roman Catholic casuists see Döllinger und Reusch, <i>Moralstreitigkeiten
im siebzehnten Jahrhundert</i> (2 vols., Nördlingen, 1889), and
various articles (&ldquo;Casuistik,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ethik,&rdquo; &ldquo;Moralsysteme,&rdquo; &amp;c.) in
Wetzer and Welte&rsquo;s <i>Kirchenlexicon</i> (Freiburg, 1880-1896). See
also the editions of Pascal&rsquo;s <i>Provincial Letters</i>, by John de Soyres
(with English notes, Cambridge, 1880), and A. Molinier (2 vols.,
Paris, 1891). The Anglican casuists are discussed in Whewell,
<i>Lectures on Moral Philosophy</i> (London, 1862). For general reflections
on the subject see the appendix to Jowett&rsquo;s edition of the
Epistle to the Romans (London, 1855). Most modern text-books on
ethics devote some attention to the matter&mdash;notably F.H. Bradley
in his <i>Ethical Studies</i> (London, 1876). See also Hastings Rashdall,
<i>Theory of Good and Evil</i> (2 vols., Oxford, 1907).</p>
